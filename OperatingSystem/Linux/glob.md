In computer programming, in particular in a Unix-like environment, __glob__ patterns specify sets of filenames with __wildcard__ characters. For example, the Unix command ```mv *.txt textfiles/``` moves (mv) all files with names ending in .txt from the current directory to the directory textfiles. Here, * is a wildcard standing for "any string of characters" and *.txt is a glob pattern. The other common wildcard is the question mark (?), which stands for one character.
