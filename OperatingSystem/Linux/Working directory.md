In computing, the __working directory__ of a process is a directory of a hierarchical file system, if any, dynamically associated with each process. It is sometimes called the current working directory or CWD, e.g. the BSD getcwd(3) function. When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process. So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt.
