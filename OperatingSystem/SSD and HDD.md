If you are going to buy a new laptop, you should check the specs like which processor, how much RAM, storage drive like SSD or HDD and how much storage space? So, things matter when you are going to purchase a laptop. But the people are confused between SSD/HDD which should I buy and how it is going to affect the overall performance of the laptop. So, stick with this article and in the end, you will know almost every thing about SSD & HDD.

##### HDD [Hard Disk Drive]

HDD stands for hard disk drive. Hard disk drive is invented by IBM [International Business Machines] in1956. When it launched it got very popular and it became the preferred storage drive in 1960’s. When it first launched, it was larger in size but after sometimes when it got very popular among the computer companies, it gets smaller in size and increases its capacity. Now, you will get HDD in very small size with a large amount of storage space.

Now, the companies produce hard drive at cheap prices. If you want to purchase a 500GB HDD, you will get it around $45-$50. Storage space is very large in Hard Disk, you will find 2TB to 4TB hard drive in the market. But the problem occurs when the hard drive has some issue because as I said previous, it has moving parts in it, so sometimes it crashes & all your saved data will be lost. The hard drive is a mechanical device and moving parts has some friction loss because of that it produced noise when it’s running. The read.write speed of HDD is around 40-50mbps. So, if you have more data backup then it takes more time to copy into hard drive.

##### SSD [Solid State Drive]

SSD stands for Solid State Drive which is the latest technology of HDD. These storage devices invented in the 1970s but these drives are comparatively expensive. When it invented, some of the companies use SSD as a RAM which is used for quick access for temporary use. But when SSD size is an increase, the companies sell it as permanent storage drives. Nowadays SSD competes for HDD on each and every function.

SSD uses flash memory instead of moving parts. Flash memory is types of storage that needs no power to keep storage on the device. Flash memory is kind of flash drives but SSD is faster and very expensive compared to other storage drives. SSD hasn’t any moving parts so there is no any type of data loss problem or drive corrupt problem. The best part of SSD is, the read/write speed of SSD is 250mbps-500mbps which is way more than HDD drives. But SSD drives are more expensive with less storage space compare to HDD. There is no moving part available so SSD is work silently. If there is SSD available on the Laptop, the performance also boosts.

So, I think I like this storage device compare to HDD. But I’m a guy who needs more storage space and faster experience at affordable rates. For a balance of storage size and performance, SSHDs are the best choice.

#### What is the difference between HDD and SSD in layman's terms?

They're both hardware devices to store data. The PC needs some way to store data even when it's turned off, unlike its RAM which is effectively cleared when the power is disconnected. Else you'd loose all your work as soon as you turn it off or there’s a power failure - even work you did years ago. So you need either one or the other.

The effect between the 2 - SSD is faster & more expensive. Lately they've become as (if not more) reliable than HDD. It used to not be the case, but these days it's been proven to have less tendency to corruption and providing longer life-times in data retention. E.g. a HDD might start "loosing" data after 5 to 10 years (some even within 2 if they're cheap low quality), but a high quality SSD comes with guarantees of 10 to 20 years. So the only downside these days is cost, and therefore size, as the larger (in storage terms) an SSD is the higher its price exponentially.

##### How it works (An analogy)

Think of a library and how it would organize books to add new books and retrieve them.

HDD is like a set of isles of shelves, each having their own librarian to move up/down the isle to find a specific book. The librarians are rather restricted in their movements, they can't easily move in more than one direction or at all. So to borrow a book you ask the head librarian and give her the book name & author (or some sort of identification like an ISBN number). She then passes along that data to the relevant sub-librarian, after figuring out which rack holds that book. The sub-librarian then figures out how high the book is (i.e. on what shelf in the isle). The shelf is moved past her until the position of the book is in front of her. She then takes it out and gives it to her superior who passes it to you.

SSD is like some futuristic library where there's only the one librarian, and a trick which makes distances to travel a non-event. The trick makes it such that all books are in direct reach of her arms and they're laid out in a nice grid pattern. So she can immediately pick up that book from its address and give it to you.

##### How it works (closer to reality)
HDD is formed like a set of discs (think of it like DVD's stacked on top of each other). Each side of the disc is coated by a substance which can be changed slightly by placing a magnetic field over it. The discs are like the isles in the library. Each side of each disc has a head (analogous to the sub-librarians, but this librarian uses magnets to both place and retrieve the book or data) which can be swung outward or inward to the line in which the data is saved. It then waits until the disc has spun past until the relevant position is directly in front of it. Since the magnetic property can either show as north / south several positions are needed for any little bit of data, e.g. usually a single character need 8 spots coded something like Morse code. After reading each spot its N/S is sent to the controller (head librarian) who then organizes them in order to send to you.

SSD is a grid of interconnected "switches". These can be tested or set using an electrical signal. The main controller simply sends down the correct wire to find the correct switch (or rather set of switches). It then interprets the result of those wires (which are on and which are off) into the contents similar to the spots read by the heads in the HDD.

硬盘有机械硬盘(HDD)和固态硬盘(SSD)之分。机械硬盘即是传统普通硬盘，主要由：盘片，磁头，盘片转轴及控制电机，磁头控制器，数据转换器，接口，缓存等几个部分组成。
磁头可沿盘片的半径方向运动，加上盘片每分钟几千转的高速旋转，磁头就可以定位在盘片的指定位置上进行数据的读写操作。信息通过离磁性表面很近的磁头，由电磁流来改变极性方式被电磁流写到磁盘上，信息可以通过相反的方式读取。 硬盘作为精密设备，尘埃是其大敌，所以进入硬盘的空气必须过滤。机械硬盘中所有的盘片都装在一个旋转轴上，每张盘片之间是平行的，在每个盘片的存储面上有一个磁头，磁头与盘片之间的距离比头发丝的直径还小，所有的磁头联在一个磁头控制器上，由磁头控制器负责各个磁头的运动。

固态硬盘（Solid State Drives），简称固盘，固态硬盘（Solid State Drive）用固态电子存储芯片阵列而制成的硬盘，由控制单元和存储单元（FLASH芯片、DRAM芯片）组成。固态硬盘在接口的规范和定义、功能及使用方法上与普通硬盘的完全相同，在产品外形和尺寸上也完全与普通硬盘一致

### 机械硬盘与固态硬盘优缺点对比

1. 防震抗摔性：机械硬盘都是磁碟型的，数据储存在磁碟扇区里。而固态硬盘是使用闪存颗粒（即内存、MP3、U盘等存储介质）制作而成，所以SSD固态硬盘内部不存在任何机械部件，这样即使在高速移动甚至伴随翻转倾斜的情况下也不会影响到正常使用，而且在发生碰撞和震荡时能够将数据丢失的可能性降到最小。相较机械硬盘，固硬占有绝对优势。  
2. 数据存储速度：从PConline评测室的评测数据来看，固态硬盘相对机械硬盘性能提升2倍多。    
3. 功耗：固态硬盘的功耗上也要低于机械硬盘。    
4. 重量：固态硬盘在重量方面更轻，与常规1.8英寸硬盘相比，重量轻20-30克。  
5. 噪音：由于固硬属于无机械部件及闪存芯片，所以具有了发热量小、散热快等特点，而且没有机械马达和风扇，工作噪音值为0分贝。机械硬盘就要逊色很多。  
6. 价格：截至目前（2014/11/23），普通品牌的128Gb 固态硬盘为450左右。而1Tb 的机械硬盘价格才360左右。固态硬盘比起机械硬盘价格较为昂贵，性价比较低。
7. 容量：固态硬盘目前最大容量为4t 3.5寸  
8. 使用寿命：SLC只有10万次的读写寿命，成本低廉的MLC，读写寿命仅有1万次。因此相对于固态硬盘，机械硬盘寿命更长。
