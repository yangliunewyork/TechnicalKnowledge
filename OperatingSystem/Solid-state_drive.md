If you are going to buy a new laptop, you should check the specs like which processor, how much RAM, storage drive like SSD or HDD and how much storage space? So, things matter when you are going to purchase a laptop. But the people are confused between SSD/HDD which should I buy and how it is going to affect the overall performance of the laptop. So, stick with this article and in the end, you will know almost every thing about SSD & HDD.

##### HDD [Hard Disk Drive]

HDD stands for hard disk drive. Hard disk drive is invented by IBM [International Business Machines] in1956. When it launched it got very popular and it became the preferred storage drive in 1960’s. When it first launched, it was larger in size but after sometimes when it got very popular among the computer companies, it gets smaller in size and increases its capacity. Now, you will get HDD in very small size with a large amount of storage space.

Now, the companies produce hard drive at cheap prices. If you want to purchase a 500GB HDD, you will get it around $45-$50. Storage space is very large in Hard Disk, you will find 2TB to 4TB hard drive in the market. But the problem occurs when the hard drive has some issue because as I said previous, it has moving parts in it, so sometimes it crashes & all your saved data will be lost. The hard drive is a mechanical device and moving parts has some friction loss because of that it produced noise when it’s running. The read.write speed of HDD is around 40-50mbps. So, if you have more data backup then it takes more time to copy into hard drive.

##### SSD [Solid State Drive]

SSD stands for Solid State Drive which is the latest technology of HDD. These storage devices invented in the 1970s but these drives are comparatively expensive. When it invented, some of the companies use SSD as a RAM which is used for quick access for temporary use. But when SSD size is an increase, the companies sell it as permanent storage drives. Nowadays SSD competes for HDD on each and every function.

SSD uses flash memory instead of moving parts. Flash memory is types of storage that needs no power to keep storage on the device. Flash memory is kind of flash drives but SSD is faster and very expensive compared to other storage drives. SSD hasn’t any moving parts so there is no any type of data loss problem or drive corrupt problem. The best part of SSD is, the read/write speed of SSD is 250mbps-500mbps which is way more than HDD drives. But SSD drives are more expensive with less storage space compare to HDD. There is no moving part available so SSD is work silently. If there is SSD available on the Laptop, the performance also boosts.

So, I think I like this storage device compare to HDD. But I’m a guy who needs more storage space and faster experience at affordable rates. For a balance of storage size and performance, SSHDs are the best choice.

#### What is the difference between HDD and SSD in layman's terms?

They're both hardware devices to store data. The PC needs some way to store data even when it's turned off, unlike its RAM which is effectively cleared when the power is disconnected. Else you'd loose all your work as soon as you turn it off or there’s a power failure - even work you did years ago. So you need either one or the other.

The effect between the 2 - SSD is faster & more expensive. Lately they've become as (if not more) reliable than HDD. It used to not be the case, but these days it's been proven to have less tendency to corruption and providing longer life-times in data retention. E.g. a HDD might start "loosing" data after 5 to 10 years (some even within 2 if they're cheap low quality), but a high quality SSD comes with guarantees of 10 to 20 years. So the only downside these days is cost, and therefore size, as the larger (in storage terms) an SSD is the higher its price exponentially.

##### How it works (An analogy)

Think of a library and how it would organize books to add new books and retrieve them.

HDD is like a set of isles of shelves, each having their own librarian to move up/down the isle to find a specific book. The librarians are rather restricted in their movements, they can't easily move in more than one direction or at all. So to borrow a book you ask the head librarian and give her the book name & author (or some sort of identification like an ISBN number). She then passes along that data to the relevant sub-librarian, after figuring out which rack holds that book. The sub-librarian then figures out how high the book is (i.e. on what shelf in the isle). The shelf is moved past her until the position of the book is in front of her. She then takes it out and gives it to her superior who passes it to you.

SSD is like some futuristic library where there's only the one librarian, and a trick which makes distances to travel a non-event. The trick makes it such that all books are in direct reach of her arms and they're laid out in a nice grid pattern. So she can immediately pick up that book from its address and give it to you.

##### How it works (closer to reality)
HDD is formed like a set of discs (think of it like DVD's stacked on top of each other). Each side of the disc is coated by a substance which can be changed slightly by placing a magnetic field over it. The discs are like the isles in the library. Each side of each disc has a head (analogous to the sub-librarians, but this librarian uses magnets to both place and retrieve the book or data) which can be swung outward or inward to the line in which the data is saved. It then waits until the disc has spun past until the relevant position is directly in front of it. Since the magnetic property can either show as north / south several positions are needed for any little bit of data, e.g. usually a single character need 8 spots coded something like Morse code. After reading each spot its N/S is sent to the controller (head librarian) who then organizes them in order to send to you.

SSD is a grid of interconnected "switches". These can be tested or set using an electrical signal. The main controller simply sends down the correct wire to find the correct switch (or rather set of switches). It then interprets the result of those wires (which are on and which are off) into the contents similar to the spots read by the heads in the HDD.
