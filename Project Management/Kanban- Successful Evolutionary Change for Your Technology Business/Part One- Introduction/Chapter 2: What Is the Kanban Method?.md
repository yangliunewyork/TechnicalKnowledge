### What is a Kanban System?

A number of kanban (or cards) equivalent to the (agreed) capacity of a system are placed in circulation. One card attaches to one piece of work. Each card acts as a signaling mechanism. A new piece of work can be started only when a card is available. This free card is attached to a piece of work and follows it as it flows through the system. When there are no more free cards, no additional work can be started. Any new work must wait in a queue until a card becomes available. When some work is completed, its card is detached and recycled. With a card now free, a new piece of work in the queuing can be started.

This mechanism is known as a pull system because new work is pulled into the system when there is capacity to handle it, rather than being pushed into the system based on demand. A pull system cannot be overloaded if the capacity, as determined by the number of signal cards in circulation, has been set appropriately.

### Kanban Applied in Software Development

In software development, we are using a virtual kanban system to limit work-in-progress. Although “kanban” means “signal card,” and there are cards used in most Kanban implementations in software development, these cards do not actually function as signals to pull more work. Instead, they represent work items. Hence the term “virtual,” because there is no physical signal card. The signal to pull new work is inferred from the visual quantity of work-in-progress subtracted from some indicator of the limit (or capacity). Some practitioners have implemented physical kanban using techniques such as sticky clips or physical slots on a board. More often the signal is generated from a software work-tracking system.

### Why Use a Kanban System?

As should become evident in subsequent chapters, we use a kanban system to limit a team’s work-in-progress to a set capacity and to balance the demand on the team against the throughput of their delivered work. By doing this we can achieve a sustainable pace of development so that all individuals can achieve a work versus personal life balance. As you will see, Kanban also quickly flushes out issues that impair performance, and it challenges a team to focus on resolving those issues in order to maintain a steady flow of work. By providing visibility onto quality and process problems, it makes obvious the impact of defects, bottlenecks, variability, and economic costs on flow and throughput. The simple act of limiting work-in-progress with kanban encourages higher quality and greater performance. The combination of improved flow and better quality helps to shorten lead times and improve predictability and due-date performance. By establishing a regular release cadence and delivering against it consistently, Kanban helps to build trust with customers and trust along the value stream with other departments, suppliers, and dependent downstream partners.

By doing all of this, Kanban contributes to the cultural evolution of organizations. By exposing problems, focusing an organization on resolving them, and eliminating their effects in future, Kanban facilitates the emergence of a highly collaborative, high-trust, highly empowered, continuously improving organization.

### Kanban as a Complex Adaptive System for Lean

The Kanban Method introduces a complex adaptive system that is intended to catalyze a Lean outcome within an organization. Complex adaptive systems have initial conditions and simple rules that are required in order to seed complex, adaptive, emergent behavior. Kanban uses five core properties to create an emergent set of Lean behaviors in organizations. These properties have been present in every successful Kanban implementation. The five properties are:

* Visualize Workflow
* Limit Work-in-Progress
* Measure and Manage Flow
* Make Process Policies Explicit
* Use Models to Recognize Improvement Opportunities”

### Emergent Behavior with Kanban

There is a growing list of emergent behaviors we have come to expect with Kanban implementations. Some or all of these have appeared in most of the recent implementations; all of them emerged at Corbis during 2007. We expect this list to grow as we learn more about the effects of Kanban on organizations.

* Process uniquely tailored to each project/value stream
* Decoupled Cadences (or “Iterationless” Development)
* Work Scheduled by (opportunity) Cost of Delay
* Value Optimized with Classes of Service
* Risk Managed with Capacity Allocation
* Tolerance for Process Experimentation
* Quantitative Management
* Viral Spread (of Kanban) across the Organization
* Small teams merged for more liquid labor pools

### Takeaways

* Kanban systems can be used in any situation in which there is a desire to limit a quantity of things inside a system.
* The Imperial Palace Gardens in Tokyo uses a kanban system to control the size of the crowd inside the park.  
* The quantity of “kanban” signal cards in circulation limits work-in-progress.  
* New work is pulled into the process by a returning signal card upon completion of a current work order or task.
* In IT work we are (generally) using a virtual kanban system as no actual physical card is passed around to define the limit to work-in-progress.  
* Card walls common in agile software development are not kanban systems.  
* Kanban systems create a positive tension in the workplace that forces discussion of problems.  
* The Kanban Method (or capital K “Kanban”) utilizes a kanban system as a catalyst of change.  
* Kanban requires that process policies are defined explicitly.  
* Kanban uses tools from various fields of knowledge to encourage analysis of problems and discovery of solutions.
* Kanban enables incremental process improvement through repeated discovery of issues affecting process performance.
* A contemporary definition of the Kanban Method can be found online at the Limited WIP Society community web site, http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/.  
* Kanban is acting as a permission giver in the software development profession, encouraging teams to devise context-specific process solutions rather than dogmatically following a software development lifecycle process definition or template.
