Dana followed a specific structure: 

1. Set the stage.  
2. Gather data.  
3. Generate insights.  
4. Decide what to do.  
5. Close the retrospective.  

### 1.1 Set the Stage

If your team doesn’t have working agreements, develop them now— before proceeding. It’s impossible to anticipate every situation; most groups can address the majority of situations with five working agree- ments. If you need more than the fingers on both hands to count your working agreements, you have too many.

You get another benefit: working agreements make everyone responsi- ble for civil behavior and collaboration, not just the retrospective leader.

The first time your team develops working agreements in a retrospec- tive, they might spend ten to fifteen minutes on them—but the agreements are reusable in future retrospectives and in daily work.

> TIP: Working Agreements Belong to the Team
> Ask your team to monitor their working agreements during the retrospective. When your team takes responsibility for their interactions, you can focus on facilitating.

As the team develops or adjusts their working agreements, notice what comes up. Working agreements are often a clue to what people are worried about.

### 1.2 Gather Data

It may seem silly to gather data for an iteration that lasted a week or two. But when someone misses one day in a weeklong iteration, they’ve missed 20% of the events and interactions. Even when people are present, they don’t see everything, and different people have differ- ent perspectives on the same event. Gathering data creates a shared picture of what happened. Without a common picture, individuals tend to verify their own opinions and beliefs. Gathering data expands every- one’s perspective.

Start with the hard data: events, metrics, features or stories com- pleted, and so forth. Events can include meetings, decision points, changes in team membership, milestones, celebrations, adopting new technologies—any event that had meaning to someone on the team. Metrics include burndown charts, velocity, defect counts, number of stories completed, amount of code refactored, effort data, and so forth. Encourage people to refer to team calendars and other artifacts—docu- ments, emails, charts—to add to the picture.
