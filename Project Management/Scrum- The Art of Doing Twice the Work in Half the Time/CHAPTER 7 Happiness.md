People want to be happy. Not happy in a complacent, sheeplike way, but in a way that is more active. Thomas Jefferson, among many others, extolled the kind of happiness that comes from a pursuit. Pursuits do seem to be what make us happy. Scrum done in the right way will make workers, customers, managers, and stockholders happy (usually in that order).

What’s fascinating is that most cultures are not set up to reward and encourage that specific type of happiness. Professor Tal Ben-Shahar taught the most popular course at Harvard University, “Positive Psychology.” In his book Happier, Ben-Shahar writes: “We are not rewarded for enjoying the journey itself but for the successful completion of a journey. Society rewards results, not processes; arrivals, not journeys.”

But our day-to-day life is mostly made up of journeys. We don’t summit peaks every day, or make the big score, or get a big bonus. Most of our days are taken up with striving toward our goals, whatever they may be. In a company, the goal may be to deliver that next great product, or make people’s lives a little better with it, or solve some problem that vexes the world. But if we get rewarded only for results, not processes, we’re going to be pretty miserable.

The importance of happiness really hit me when I was setting up my first Scrum team. I realized that I had to address the team’s emotional state as well as its mental state. For a West Point–trained fighter pilot, this was something of an adjustment. I was used to things being cut-and-dried. Being clinical and scientific, it took me some time to figure out that to empower people, to change their lives for the better, I had to change myself. Over the course of that first Scrum effort I realized that true greatness is deeply rooted in joy. And that to be joyful is to take the first step toward success.

That’s because happiness is crucial to your business and is actually a better forward predictor of revenue than most of the metrics your CFO provides. 

### Happiness Is Success

The research is startlingly clear. Happy people simply do better—at home, at work, in life. They make more money, they have better jobs, they graduate from college, and they live longer. It’s quite remarkable. Almost universally they’re just better at what they do.

Happy people sell more stuff, make more money, cost less, are less likely to leave their jobs, are healthier, and live longer. Or as a 2005 paper that did a meta-analysis of some 225 papers with over 275,000 participants put it:

>  Happiness leads to success in nearly every domain of our lives, including marriage, health, friendship, community involvement, creativity, and, in particular, our jobs, careers, and businesses.

The meta-analysts showed that people who felt happy were more likely to secure job interviews, be evaluated more positively by supervisors, show superior performance and productivity, and be better managers.

Here’s the really interesting part, though. It intuitively makes sense that happy people do better—it’s because of their success that they’re happy, right? Wrong. From that same meta-analysis: “Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving.”

That’s right. People aren’t happy because they’re successful; they’re successful because they’re happy. Happiness is a predictive measure. And performance improves even if people are only a little bit happier. You don’t have to change someone’s life dramatically to make them happier, at least temporarily. Even just a little bit of happiness leads to markedly better outcomes. People don’t have to be deliriously, wedding-day happy, just a little bit happier than they were. Of course, making them even happier has an even greater effect. But the message I want you to take away from this is simple: even small gestures can have great impact. What Scrum is focused on is taking those small things and systematically building them up into a scaffolding for success. Just one thing at a time, and you can actually change the world.

I’m going to give you a tool kit to measure your happiness and the happiness of your team, company, and family, as well as any organization you happen to be involved with. That is what Scrum does. Forget trust-building exercises, and instead build trust every single day. And I want you to measure it. It’s not enough to think people are happy. I want you to be a scientist about it: quantify it and equate it with performance. If something doesn’t match up, there’s a problem. It’s great to go to the pub with your team and bond. But it doesn’t do the company a lot of good if that bonding doesn’t actually translate into better performance. There are a lot of people I hang with just for fun. With my team I want that social aspect to move directly into performance. And it does.
