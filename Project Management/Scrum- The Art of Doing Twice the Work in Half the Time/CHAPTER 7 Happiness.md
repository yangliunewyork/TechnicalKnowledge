People want to be happy. Not happy in a complacent, sheeplike way, but in a way that is more active. Thomas Jefferson, among many others, extolled the kind of happiness that comes from a pursuit. Pursuits do seem to be what make us happy. Scrum done in the right way will make workers, customers, managers, and stockholders happy (usually in that order).

What’s fascinating is that most cultures are not set up to reward and encourage that specific type of happiness. Professor Tal Ben-Shahar taught the most popular course at Harvard University, “Positive Psychology.” In his book Happier, Ben-Shahar writes: “We are not rewarded for enjoying the journey itself but for the successful completion of a journey. Society rewards results, not processes; arrivals, not journeys.”

But our day-to-day life is mostly made up of journeys. We don’t summit peaks every day, or make the big score, or get a big bonus. Most of our days are taken up with striving toward our goals, whatever they may be. In a company, the goal may be to deliver that next great product, or make people’s lives a little better with it, or solve some problem that vexes the world. But if we get rewarded only for results, not processes, we’re going to be pretty miserable.

The importance of happiness really hit me when I was setting up my first Scrum team. I realized that I had to address the team’s emotional state as well as its mental state. For a West Point–trained fighter pilot, this was something of an adjustment. I was used to things being cut-and-dried. Being clinical and scientific, it took me some time to figure out that to empower people, to change their lives for the better, I had to change myself. Over the course of that first Scrum effort I realized that true greatness is deeply rooted in joy. And that to be joyful is to take the first step toward success.

That’s because happiness is crucial to your business and is actually a better forward predictor of revenue than most of the metrics your CFO provides. 

### Happiness Is Success

The research is startlingly clear. Happy people simply do better—at home, at work, in life. They make more money, they have better jobs, they graduate from college, and they live longer. It’s quite remarkable. Almost universally they’re just better at what they do.

Happy people sell more stuff, make more money, cost less, are less likely to leave their jobs, are healthier, and live longer. Or as a 2005 paper that did a meta-analysis of some 225 papers with over 275,000 participants put it:

>  Happiness leads to success in nearly every domain of our lives, including marriage, health, friendship, community involvement, creativity, and, in particular, our jobs, careers, and businesses.

The meta-analysts showed that people who felt happy were more likely to secure job interviews, be evaluated more positively by supervisors, show superior performance and productivity, and be better managers.

Here’s the really interesting part, though. It intuitively makes sense that happy people do better—it’s because of their success that they’re happy, right? Wrong. From that same meta-analysis: “Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving.”

That’s right. People aren’t happy because they’re successful; they’re successful because they’re happy. Happiness is a predictive measure. And performance improves even if people are only a little bit happier. You don’t have to change someone’s life dramatically to make them happier, at least temporarily. Even just a little bit of happiness leads to markedly better outcomes. People don’t have to be deliriously, wedding-day happy, just a little bit happier than they were. Of course, making them even happier has an even greater effect. But the message I want you to take away from this is simple: even small gestures can have great impact. What Scrum is focused on is taking those small things and systematically building them up into a scaffolding for success. Just one thing at a time, and you can actually change the world.

I’m going to give you a tool kit to measure your happiness and the happiness of your team, company, and family, as well as any organization you happen to be involved with. That is what Scrum does. Forget trust-building exercises, and instead build trust every single day. And I want you to measure it. It’s not enough to think people are happy. I want you to be a scientist about it: quantify it and equate it with performance. If something doesn’t match up, there’s a problem. It’s great to go to the pub with your team and bond. But it doesn’t do the company a lot of good if that bonding doesn’t actually translate into better performance. There are a lot of people I hang with just for fun. With my team I want that social aspect to move directly into performance. And it does.

### Quantifying Happiness

How do we make ourselves, our employees, and our fellow team members happy? How do we channel that happiness into greater productivity and revenue?

To answer those questions, I need to take you back to Toyota and Taiichi Ohno’s crusade to eliminate waste. That goal led him to the idea of “continuous improvement.” It isn’t enough to reach a certain level of productivity and stay there; the idea is to constantly examine your processes so as to improve them constantly and forever. Perfection can never be reached, of course, but every increment in that direction counts.

Just as work needs to be broken down into manageable chunks and time needs to be broken down into manageable pieces, improvement needs to be sliced to a step at a time. In Japanese the word used is kaizen, or “improvement.” What is the little improvement that can be done right away that will make things better?

In Scrum this is captured at the end of each Sprint in what I call the “Sprint Retrospective.” After the team has shown what they’ve accomplished during the last Sprint—that thing that is “Done” and can potentially be shipped to customers for feedback—they sit down and think about what went right, what could have gone better, and what can be made better in the next Sprint. What is the improvement in the process that they, as a team, can implement right away?

To be effective, this meeting requires a certain amount of emotional maturity and an atmosphere of trust. The key thing to remember is that you’re not seeking someone to blame; you’re looking at the process. Why did that happen that way? Why did we miss that? What could make us faster? It is crucial that people as a team take responsibility for their process and outcomes, and seek solutions as a team. At the same time, people have to have the fortitude to bring up the issues that are really bothering them in a way that is solution oriented rather than accusatory. And the rest of the team has to have the maturity to hear the feedback, take it in, and look for a solution rather than get defensive.

The Retrospective meeting is the “Check” part of Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The key is getting to that “Act” step, that kaizen, which will actually change the process and make it better the next time. It’s not good enough merely to share how you feel; you need to be able to act.

The best way I’ve found to capture all this is with what I call the “Happiness Metric.” It’s a simple but very effective way of getting at what the kaizen should be, but also which kaizen will make people the happiest. And I’ve used it with pretty remarkable results.

Here’s how it works. At the end of each Sprint each person on the team answers just a few questions:”

1. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company?  
2. On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole?  
3. Why do you feel that way?  
4. What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?  

That’s it. It can be done in just a few minutes. Every person on the team takes a turn, and it sparks really insightful conversations. Together the team usually comes up with a kaizen quite quickly. The method exposes what is most important to each team member, and what they think is most important for the company.

And here’s the crucial piece. The team takes that one top improvement and makes it the most important thing to do in the next Sprint—with acceptance tests. How can you prove you’ve made that improvement? You need to define what success is in a concrete, actionable way, so that in the next Sprint Retrospective it’s really easy to see if you achieved the kaizen.

### Make Everything Visible

What are the things that actually make people happy? They’re the same things that make great teams: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Or to say it more expansively, it’s the ability to control your own destiny, it’s the feeling that you’re getting better at something, and it’s knowing that you’re serving something bigger than yourself. But there are also some easy, concrete steps management can take to get the culture of the company to encourage those qualities.

One element of Scrum that’s often a prelude to achieving autonomy, mastery, and purpose is transparency. The idea is that there should be no secret cabal, no hidden agendas, nothing behind the curtain. Far too often in a company it isn’t really clear what everyone is working on, or how each person’s daily activity advances the goals of the company.

As I’ve said before, I’m not very interested in individual performance; I’m only interested in team performance. I can double a team’s productivity in a month, but an individual? That could take a year. And a whole bunch of individuals? A whole division? A whole company? That could take forever. So I use transparency to focus on improving the team. I find that the team itself usually can address individual performance issues. They actually know what people are doing, who is helping, who is hurting, who makes the team great, and who makes it painful.

Now, there is software out there that can measure all sorts of things, give you all sorts of metrics and analysis, but a Scrum board is just a bunch of sticky notes on a whiteboard. There are three task-status levels: To Do, Doing, and Done. When someone signs out a story, everyone knows who’s working on it. And everyone knows when it’s done. And because the board has sticky notes that represent everything that needs to be done in a single Sprint, everyone knows how the Sprint is going. Anyone can walk into the room, glance at the board, and know exactly how the team is doing.

Because the team knows what has been done and what still needs to be done, they can regulate themselves. They know what they have to do, they can see if a colleague is in trouble, if a story has been in the Doing column too long. The team can self-organize to defeat problems that become obvious once everything is transparent.

### Delivering Happiness

In talking to executives at Zappos, one of the words you hear a lot is connection. Their research shows that the more connected people are to other people at work, the happier they are—and, apparently, the more productive and innovative as well. So the company execs have set out deliberately to create these connections—not only on one team, or in one department, but across the whole company. And not just between people at one level, but between different levels, everyone from VPs to Accounts Receivable clerks.

Another way that Zappos keeps people happy is by giving employees a chance to learn and grow. The company almost always prefers to hire internally. Say a job in HR is posted, and someone in accounting, who has always thought he might like that kind of work, sees it. That person who is curious about HR might then be brought into an “apprenticeship.” It gives the employee the chance to see if he really does like that work, and it gives the manager a chance to see if he’d make a good fit with the team. The company also offers free classes taught by other employees—Finance 101, Coding for Beginners, whatever. Zappos wants people to grow at and within the company.

As I mentioned in chapter three, on teams, people want to grow; they want to get better at what they’re doing and find what else they can get better at. The idea is that mastering work motivates people. Giving people the chance to find out where they fit helps Zappos keep employees happy, excited, and engaged.

That’s what Zappos wants, what any company should want. It’s what I want. I want people to love coming to work. It’s a change in mind-set. From working for a company to working with my company. 

### Pop the Happy Bubble

The Harvard Business Review focused its entire 2012 January–February issue on happiness. What they found was

> … that the only route to employee happiness that also benefits shareholders is through a sense of fulfillment resulting from an important job done well. We should aspire not just to make employees “happy,” but to do so by helping them achieve great things. In short, we should earn our employees’ passionate advocacy for the company’s mission and success by helping them earn the passionate advocacy of customers.

What these “thrivers” share is what I’ve been writing about throughout this chapter—each thriver is vital and passionate, and each is trying to perfect their craft, whether they belong to an airplane crew or are a busboy in a restaurant. What can companies do to create an atmosphere in which people thrive? Managers can encourage autonomy by letting people make their own decisions about their job. And they can make sure that employees know everything that’s going on, because, as they put it, “Doing your job in an information vacuum is tedious and uninspiring.” Managers should also have zero tolerance for incivility and never allow an employee to poison corporate culture through abuse or disrespect. And, finally, they should give quick and direct feedback.

Scrum gives people all those things. It’s set up to make them happen, especially the direct feedback, which happens every day in the Daily Stand-up meeting, and which is what the Sprint Retrospective and the Happiness Metric are designed to illuminate.

There’s one caution I’d like to lay out, though. It’s possible—heck, it happens often enough that I’ve spent significant time studying it—for a “happy bubble” to develop. This usually happens after a team has achieved some big success or increased their productivity greatly by using Scrum. They’ve self-organized, and they feel proud of their progress. And that’s when complacency can set in. They say to themselves, Hey, we’ve improved so much, we don’t need to improve any more. They hit a productivity plateau and pretty soon thereafter cease to do great work. But they’re good enough that, for a time, they live in this happy bubble that insulates them from unpleasant truths. They don’t realize that continuous improvement means just that: it never, ever stops. When I was a fighter pilot we used to say after three thousand hours in the cockpit you need to quit because you become complacent, and that could kill you. While a complacent team might be less risky in business, ongoing team performance is at risk.

### Happy Today, Happy Tomorrow

The first type, the “Hedonist,” is someone who is doing what makes them happy right now. Tomorrow? Let tomorrow worry about tomorrow. I’ll just enjoy today. I see this kind of behavior a lot in start-ups: a bunch of people in the figurative garage just making stuff, because it’s cool and it’s fun. But there isn’t a lot of attention paid to creating a sustainable product. Very little mental energy is channeled into how this thing will be working in a month, let alone a year down the road.

And what usually happens is that the investors in these guys get worried. So they hire a bunch of managers to ride herd on the hackers. And, suddenly, the hackers find that the world they enjoyed so much now sucks. There are now all sorts of rules and tests and reports. It sucks today, and they think it will suck forever. Call them now the “Nihilists.”

Then there are the guys who were brought in to run the place. They’re the ones willing to put in eighty-hour weeks (and willing to whip others to do so), because they think they’ll get promoted later, and they’ll be happier. Of course, when they do get promoted, they just have a new set of headaches to contend with that require more time. They enjoy the rat race.

The fourth type of person is the one that Scrum tries to identify and encourage—the individual who is working at stuff that is fun today but has an eye toward a better future and who is convinced it will be fun forever. This sort of person rarely experiences burnout or disillusionment. He’s spared the negative feelings toward work suffered by the hedonists, the nihilists, and the rat-race-addicted managers who strive to make everybody toe the line.

What Scrum does is promote a single, galvanizing mind-set. By having everyone work together, the team helps the hedonist look ahead, convinces the nihilist there is a future without whining, and tells those managers stuck in an unending rat race that there actually is a better way.

That’s why I implemented the Happiness Metric in my company. It helps the team help its members become better people. It removes the causes of unhappiness systematically, carefully, and incrementally. It empowers people to change themselves and attaches an incentive to doing so.

Remember the Fundamental Attribution Error? When you’re surrounded by assholes, don’t look for bad people; look for bad systems that reward them for acting that way. Then you use the Happiness Metric to fix it.

In high school or college many of us studied the American psychologist Abraham Maslow’s “hierarchy of needs.” It laid out, in pyramid form, the needs that humans take care of first and then those that become more pressing as lower ones are satisfied. At the pyramid’s base are physiological needs: air, water, food, clothing, and shelter. If we don’t have those, we can’t even begin to think about anything else. The next layer is safety—not just physical and financial, but also the assurance of good health. It’s important to have some access to medical care. Interestingly, many people stop there, even though the next layer holds what we absolutely need as humans but that society often ignores: love and belonging—that connectedness Zappos talks about. Above that is the need for self-esteem and respect from others. And at the pyramid’s very top is the need to achieve one’s full potential.

It’s that top layer that Maslow was most interested in, and that Scrum focuses on: helping people achieve personal growth and fulfillment. People high up on that pyramid are not only happier and more fulfilled, they’re more effective and innovative. And they’re able to deliver greatness.

“It’s not enough just to be happy. Happiness needs to be harnessed to produce results. All the elements of Scrum come together to help a person do just that. The real trick? Priorities. 


### THE TAKEAWAY

* It’s the Journey, Not the Destination. True happiness is found in the process, not the result. Often we only reward results, but what we really want to reward is people striving toward greatness.   
* Happy Is the New Black. It helps you make smarter decisions. Plus, when you’re happy, you’re more creative, less likely to leave your job, and more likely to accomplish far more than you ever anticipated.   
* Quantify Happiness. It’s not enough just to feel good; you need to measure that feeling and compare it to actual performance. Other metrics look backward. Happiness is a future-looking metric.    
* Get Better Every Day—and Measure It. At the end of each Sprint, the team should pick one small improvement, or kaizen, that will make them happier. And that should become the most important thing they’ll accomplish in the next Sprint.    
* Secrecy Is Poison. Nothing should be secret. Everyone should know everything, and that includes salaries and financials. Obfuscation only serves people who serve themselves.    
* “Make Work Visible. Have a board that shows all the work that needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what is actually done. Everyone should see it, and everyone should update it every day.  
* Happiness Is Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. Everyone wants to control their own destiny, get better at what they do, and serve a purpose greater than themselves.  
* Pop the Happy Bubble. Don’t get so happy that you start believing your own bullshit. Make sure happiness is measured against performance, and if there is a disconnect, be prepared to act. Complacency is the enemy of success.
