The heart of Scrum is rhythm. Rhythm is deeply important to human beings. Its beat is heard in the thrumming of our blood and rooted in some of the deepest recesses of our brains. We’re pattern seekers, driven to seek out rhythm in all aspects of our lives.

However, the patterns we seek aren’t necessarily rewarding or optimized to bring us happiness. For example, there are the negative rhythms of the addict and the depressed. You can walk the halls of just about any office building and see these negative patterns made manifest. They’re likely to be found anywhere that someone feels frustrated at being stymied, or quietly desperate as it dawns on them that they’re trapped in an uncaring system, or angry at being viewed as a cog in a machine.

This is part of the human experience. You can go back thousands of years and read the writings of other people, just like us, whose lives were caught up in a system they felt helpless against. But we seem to have mastered that trapped feeling sometime during the twentieth century. Throughout the business environment especially, we created an acute depersonalization that seems dictated by fate.

What Scrum does is create a different kind of pattern. It accepts that we’re habit-driven creatures, seekers of rhythm, somewhat predictable, but also somewhat magical and capable of greatness. When I created Scrum, I thought, What if I can take human patterns and make them positive rather than negative? What if I can design a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle that encourages the best parts of ourselves and diminishes the worst? In giving Scrum a daily and weekly rhythm, I guess what I was striving for was to offer people the chance to like the person they see in the mirror.

But there are pitfalls. What look like virtuous patterns can end up being nothing but folly—nothing but waste. That’s what I’m going to spend this chapter talking about: the waste that infects our work, the cancer that eats at our productivity, our organizations, our lives, and our society.

I briefly introduced Toyota’s Taiichi Ohno in the first chapter of this book, where he said, “Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss.” His thoughts about waste deeply influenced mine, and I want to spend some time talking about them.

Ohno talked about three different types of waste. He used the Japanese words: Muri, waste through unreasonableness; Mura, waste through inconsistency; and Muda, waste through outcomes. These ideas are highly aligned with Deming’s PDCA cycle, which I wrote about earlier: Plan, Do, Check, Act. Plan means avoid Muri. Do means avoid Mura. Check means avoid Muda. Act means the will, motivation, and determination to do all that. I’m going to go through these steps one at a time and point out what to avoid—from waste in inventory, to the waste of not doing it right the first time, to the waste of working too hard, to the emotional waste of unreasonable expectations.

### Do One Thing at a Time

The ability to juggle seems so attractive—especially in an age in which information is flowing through a thousand different pipelines and “must do nows” are proliferating. We want to be that guy—the Super-Juggler. We tell ourselves we can. Unfortunately, we can’t. And the more we think we can, the worse we actually are at it.

“Here’s a quote from my favorite paper on the subject:

> … even when participants direct their gaze at objects in the driving environment, they often fail to “see” them when they are talking on a cell phone because attention has been directed away from the external environment and toward an internal, cognitive context associated with the phone conversation.

What does this mean when you’re trying to get things done? Well, let’s look at a typical team. This year they’ve decided to do three projects. Let’s call them A, B, and C. And they plan out their year, saying they’ll do a little bit on this project, then that one, and then the next one, so their calendar looks like what’s shown on this figure.

<img src="https://ouchris.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/prioritization.png">

By trying to do everything at once—the classic strategy—completing those three projects will take them till the end of July. But by approaching the aggregate in a Scrum fashion, by driving each project to Done one at a time, they minimize the cost of context switching. They’re able to finish by the beginning of May.

They don’t change how big the project is, or what’s involved in creating it, but just by doing one thing exclusively before moving on, the work takes a little more than half as much time. Half.

And the other half? That’s pure waste. Not a thing more is produced. Not a dollar saved. Not a new innovation implemented. It is just a waste of human life. It’s working for no purpose.

So that’s the cost of multitasking. We all live in a world where there are multiple demands on our time. People want different things from us: the phone rings with a really important call, the kids arrive home from school, the boss walks into our office. What I want you to do, though, is be conscious of the cost of context switching. It’s very real, and you should try to minimize it.

If you’re working with something complicated—for example, writing a report, creating a presentation, developing a piece of software, or crafting a book, you’re holding an incredibly complex object in your mind. You must take into account dozens of factors, remember what you’ve done, where you want to go, and what the impediments might be. That’s a pretty tricky thing to do. And what happens if you’re interrupted or have to switch quickly to another project, even just for a moment? You guessed it: that carefully built mental architecture collapses. It can take hours of work just to get back to the same state of awareness. That’s the cost. So minimize that waste by trying to do all at once those tasks that require a specific kind of concentration. Put those tasks into blocks of time where it’s possible to shut off your phone and put up a “Do not disturb!” sign.

Some research has actually been done that shows that multitasking not only wastes your time but makes you stupid. A study done at the University of London back in 20057 (admittedly, a very small non-peer-reviewed study, but still) measured how stupid multitasking can make you. Psychiatrist Glenn Wilson took four men and four women and tested their IQ under quiet conditions and distracting conditions (phones ringing, e-mail arriving). During the tests he measured the subjects’ skin conductance, heart rate, and blood pressure. And, interestingly, the mean IQ scores of the subjects dropped by more than ten points when in distracting environments. Even more interesting, the drop-off was worse for men than women. (Perhaps, for some reason, women are more habituated to distraction.)

### Half Done Isn’t Done at All

As I’ve mentioned, Scrum takes a lot of its thinking from the Japanese manufacturing model that was codified in the classic book Toyota Production System by Taiichi Ohno. In the United States this model has been interpreted as “Lean” manufacturing. Basically, the idea is to eliminate as much waste as possible on the factory floor. Now, most of us aren’t looking to improve flow through an automobile plant, but some of the ideas are applicable to any kind of work at all.

One idea I want to address here is called “Work in Process,” or sometimes just “inventory.” The idea is that it’s wasteful to have a bunch of stuff lying around that isn’t being used to build something. That stuff, whether it be car doors or widgets, actually costs money, and if it’s sitting around on the factory floor, it means that huge amounts of money are bound up in inventory that isn’t actually needed right then. This changes how you look at things that are in process. If, for example, all an auto company has is a bunch of half-built cars, it has expended a lot of money and effort but hasn’t created anything of real value. In Lean manufacturing, the idea is to minimize the amount of half-built stuff lying around.

As I’ve said, in Scrum there is a rhythm to the work. Every iteration, or Sprint, the team tries to get a number of things done. But that “Done” implies a complete, deliverable product that can be used by a customer. If something is half done at the end of the Sprint, you’re worse off than if you hadn’t started at all. You’ve expended resources, effort, and time and gotten nothing to a deliverable state. You have a half-constructed car. It might have been better to create something smaller—something that really works.

Jobs that aren’t done and products that aren’t being used are two aspects of the same thing: invested effort with no positive outcome. Don’t do it.

### Do It Right the First Time

In a Toyota plant when a problem shows up on the line, every worker has the ability to stop the whole line. When that happens, everyone swarms around where the line stopped—not to yell at the guy for stopping the line, but to fix whatever problem is there. They don’t want any cars coming out the other end with things that have to be fixed. They fix the problem once, and it’s solved forever. If they don’t, that same defect could go into hundreds of vehicles.

At European luxury-car makers there was a different way of doing things. At the end of the production line were dozens of people in white lab coats going around fixing all the problems. They made sure the car door had that BMW clunk when the door closed, or the engine purred with exactly the right tone. They made sure all the parts meshed together properly. They viewed themselves not as manufacturers but as craftsmen, artisans making a thing of beauty. That’s great when you’re making a few cars, but when you’re making millions, those costs add up. As Womack reports in his book:

> … the German plant was expending more effort to fix the problems it had just created than the Japanese plant required to make a nearly perfect car the first time.

You read that right. The Germans spent more time fixing a car they’d just made than the Japanese did making one in the first place. There’s a reason Toyota became the number one car manufacturer on the planet. They did it right the first time.

But we don’t always do things perfectly the first time. We’re human; we make mistakes. How you deal with those mistakes can have an extraordinary impact on how fast you can get things done, and at what level of quality. At Toyota, as I said, every worker in the factory can stop the line. The idea is that the process is being continuously improved, and that the right moment to fix a problem is when it is observed, not after the fact.

It took twenty-four times longer. If a bug was addressed on the day it was created, it would take an hour to fix; three weeks later, it would take twenty-four hours. It didn’t even matter if the bug was big or small, complicated or simple—it always took twenty-four times longer three weeks later. As you can imagine, every software developer in the company was soon required to test and fix their code on the same day.

The human mind has limits. We can only remember so many things; we can really only concentrate on one thing at a time. This tendency—for the process of fixing things to get harder as more time elapses—represents a similar limitation. When you’re working on a project, there’s a whole mind space that you create around it. You know all the different reasons why something is being done. You’re holding a pretty complicated construct in your head. Re-creating that construct a week later is hard. You have to remember all the factors that you were considering when you made that choice. You have to re-create the thought process that led you to that decision. You have to become your past self again, put yourself back inside a mind that no longer exists. Doing that takes time. A long time. Twenty-four times as long as it would take if you had fixed the problem when you first discovered it.

I’m sure you’ve had this experience yourself in your own work, and the lesson is one you were probably taught as a child: Do things right the first time. The only thing the data now adds is that if you do make a mistake—and we all make them—fix it as soon as you notice it. If you don’t, you’ll pay for it.

### Working Too Hard Makes More Work

A lot of companies don’t practice [work-hour limits],” says Scott. “But there is a direct correlation. You get more done. You are happier. And you have higher quality.” It’s a no-brainer. Working less helps you get more done with higher quality.

Scott says the curve is different for different people, even for the same person at different times in their lives. “I’ve noticed as I’ve gotten older and in different roles that the peak output for me is at a lower number of hours than it was twenty years ago,” he says. Physical fitness, diet, personal issues, and other factors all play a role, he thinks. But he also believes that his output reaches its peak faster as he has grown and thought quite deeply about how to work. “I’ve been able to attack more and more important-impact opportunities.”

Why is it that if you work fewer hours, you get more done? It doesn’t really seem to make sense on the face of it. Scott says that people who work too many hours start making mistakes, which, as we’ve seen, can actually take more effort to fix than to create. Overworked employees get more distracted and begin distracting others. Soon they’re making bad decisions.
Jon Katzenbach’s instincts were right. The disturbing evidence reveals that we have a very limited capability to make decisions, and the more energy-depleted we are, and the less downtime we get, the worse we are at it.

When we don’t have any energy reserves left, we’re prone to start making unsound decisions.

This phenomenon has been labeled “ego depletion.” The idea is that making any choice involves an energy cost. It’s an odd sort of exhaustion—you don’t feel physically tired, but your capacity to make good decisions diminishes. What really changes is your self-control—your ability to be disciplined, thoughtful, and prescient.

Scrum asks those who engage in it to break from the mind-set of measuring merely hours. Hours themselves represent a cost. Instead, measure output. Who cares how many hours someone worked on something? All that matters is how fast it’s delivered and how good it is.

### Be Reasonable

There are three types of waste identified by Taiichi Ohno that lead to people working harder, and for more hours, than necessary. I’ve just pointed out why that’s an incredibly bad idea, but recognizing these types of waste, which Ohno called Muri, or “Unreasonableness,” is perhaps the most powerful lever for change we can reach.

The first is “Absurdity.” You want to give your team challenging goals—to push them to reach for more. But you don’t want them striving for absurd, impossible goals.

The second is “Unreasonable Expectations.” How many times have you heard someone brag that through their own heroic efforts they saved a project? Usually this is greeted with backslaps, cheers, and congratulations. I see this as a fundamental flaw in the process. A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it’s supposed to work. Constantly moving from one crisis to the next causes burnout, and it doesn’t allow for reasoned, continuous improvement. It’s the difference between a cowboy riding in and rescuing the girl from the bad guys and a disciplined Marine platoon clearing the kill zone.

Ohno called the third type of waste “Overburden.” It’s the sort of behavior that Scott Adams regularly lampoons in his Dilbert cartoons. It includes onerous company policies that get in the way, unnecessary reporting that has people filling out forms for the sake of filling out forms, and meaningless meetings that suck up time and don’t deliver any value.
While Ohno didn’t mention a fourth type of waste, one comes to mind—i.e., “Emotional Waste.” That type of waste is generated when a company has an asshole in its midst—someone who likes spinning up other people and putting them in a tizzy. Assholes often justify their behavior by claiming they’re simply trying to make people work better. But they’re merely indulging the negative aspects of their personality, and nothing is more undermining of a team’s ability to excel.

Don’t be an asshole—and don’t allow, abet, or accept that behavior in others.

### Flow

In a theoretically perfect world, there would be no process, no meetings, no forms, no reporting. Instead, there’d be the creation of exactly what the customer wants, even if the customer didn’t know they wanted it yet. Any “process” that people use is wasteful, and that includes Scrum.

But we don’t live in a perfect world, and bad processes are so ingrained in our thinking that, as an alternative, we need the lightest-weight process with the greatest impact on work. What Scrum does is focus us on trying to eliminate the pointless waste that seems part and parcel of work. I’ve tried to make it so that the process itself is the least disturbing framework you can have and still keep people focused.

What you really want in your work is effortless “flow.” In the martial arts or in meditative practice, when you reach a sense of oneness with a motion, it is no longer an effort; it is energy effortlessly flowing through you. When you watch great dancers or singers, you sense that they’re surrendering to a force greater than themselves as they let their art move through them. Reaching that spot in our work is what we should all seek.

But as the kung fu master, the monk, the dancer, or the opera star will all tell you, at the root of flow is discipline. There can be no wasted movement—nothing extraneous—just focused application of human capability. Waste is anything that distracts you from that. If you start thinking about work in terms of discipline and flow, you might just do something amazing.

# THE TAKEAWAY

* Multitasking Makes You Stupid. Doing more than one thing at a time makes you slower and worse at both tasks. Don’t do it. If you think this doesn’t apply to you, you’re wrong—it does.  
* Half-Done Is Not Done. A half-built car simply ties up resources that could be used to create value or save money. Anything that’s “in process” costs money and energy without delivering anything.  
* Do It Right the First Time. When you make a mistake, fix it right away. Stop everything else and address it. Fixing it later can take you more than twenty times longer than if you fix it now.  
* Working Too Hard Only Makes More Work. Working long hours doesn’t get more done; it gets less done. Working too much results in fatigue, which leads to errors, which leads to having to fix the thing you just finished. Rather than work late or on the weekends, work weekdays only at a sustainable pace. And take a vacation.  
* Don’t Be Unreasonable. Goals that are challenging are motivators; goals that are impossible are just depressing.  
* No Heroics. If you need a hero to get things done, you have a problem. Heroic effort should be viewed as a failure of planning.  
* Enough with the Stupid Policies. Any policy that seems ridiculous likely is. Stupid forms, stupid meetings, stupid approvals, stupid standards are just that—stupid. If your office seems like a Dilbert cartoon, fix it.  
* No Assholes. Don’t be one, and don’t allow the behavior. Anyone who causes emotional chaos, inspires fear or dread, or demeans or diminishes people needs to be stopped cold.  
* Strive for Flow. Choose the smoothest, most trouble-free way to get things done. Scrum is about enabling the most flow possible.
