The heart of Scrum is rhythm. Rhythm is deeply important to human beings. Its beat is heard in the thrumming of our blood and rooted in some of the deepest recesses of our brains. We’re pattern seekers, driven to seek out rhythm in all aspects of our lives.

However, the patterns we seek aren’t necessarily rewarding or optimized to bring us happiness. For example, there are the negative rhythms of the addict and the depressed. You can walk the halls of just about any office building and see these negative patterns made manifest. They’re likely to be found anywhere that someone feels frustrated at being stymied, or quietly desperate as it dawns on them that they’re trapped in an uncaring system, or angry at being viewed as a cog in a machine.

This is part of the human experience. You can go back thousands of years and read the writings of other people, just like us, whose lives were caught up in a system they felt helpless against. But we seem to have mastered that trapped feeling sometime during the twentieth century. Throughout the business environment especially, we created an acute depersonalization that seems dictated by fate.

What Scrum does is create a different kind of pattern. It accepts that we’re habit-driven creatures, seekers of rhythm, somewhat predictable, but also somewhat magical and capable of greatness. When I created Scrum, I thought, What if I can take human patterns and make them positive rather than negative? What if I can design a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle that encourages the best parts of ourselves and diminishes the worst? In giving Scrum a daily and weekly rhythm, I guess what I was striving for was to offer people the chance to like the person they see in the mirror.

But there are pitfalls. What look like virtuous patterns can end up being nothing but folly—nothing but waste. That’s what I’m going to spend this chapter talking about: the waste that infects our work, the cancer that eats at our productivity, our organizations, our lives, and our society.

I briefly introduced Toyota’s Taiichi Ohno in the first chapter of this book, where he said, “Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss.” His thoughts about waste deeply influenced mine, and I want to spend some time talking about them.

Ohno talked about three different types of waste. He used the Japanese words: Muri, waste through unreasonableness; Mura, waste through inconsistency; and Muda, waste through outcomes. These ideas are highly aligned with Deming’s PDCA cycle, which I wrote about earlier: Plan, Do, Check, Act. Plan means avoid Muri. Do means avoid Mura. Check means avoid Muda. Act means the will, motivation, and determination to do all that. I’m going to go through these steps one at a time and point out what to avoid—from waste in inventory, to the waste of not doing it right the first time, to the waste of working too hard, to the emotional waste of unreasonable expectations.

### Do One Thing at a Time

The ability to juggle seems so attractive—especially in an age in which information is flowing through a thousand different pipelines and “must do nows” are proliferating. We want to be that guy—the Super-Juggler. We tell ourselves we can. Unfortunately, we can’t. And the more we think we can, the worse we actually are at it.

“Here’s a quote from my favorite paper on the subject:

> … even when participants direct their gaze at objects in the driving environment, they often fail to “see” them when they are talking on a cell phone because attention has been directed away from the external environment and toward an internal, cognitive context associated with the phone conversation.

What does this mean when you’re trying to get things done? Well, let’s look at a typical team. This year they’ve decided to do three projects. Let’s call them A, B, and C. And they plan out their year, saying they’ll do a little bit on this project, then that one, and then the next one, so their calendar looks like what’s shown on this figure.

<img src="https://ouchris.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/prioritization.png">

By trying to do everything at once—the classic strategy—completing those three projects will take them till the end of July. But by approaching the aggregate in a Scrum fashion, by driving each project to Done one at a time, they minimize the cost of context switching. They’re able to finish by the beginning of May.

They don’t change how big the project is, or what’s involved in creating it, but just by doing one thing exclusively before moving on, the work takes a little more than half as much time. Half.

And the other half? That’s pure waste. Not a thing more is produced. Not a dollar saved. Not a new innovation implemented. It is just a waste of human life. It’s working for no purpose.

So that’s the cost of multitasking. We all live in a world where there are multiple demands on our time. People want different things from us: the phone rings with a really important call, the kids arrive home from school, the boss walks into our office. What I want you to do, though, is be conscious of the cost of context switching. It’s very real, and you should try to minimize it.

If you’re working with something complicated—for example, writing a report, creating a presentation, developing a piece of software, or crafting a book, you’re holding an incredibly complex object in your mind. You must take into account dozens of factors, remember what you’ve done, where you want to go, and what the impediments might be. That’s a pretty tricky thing to do. And what happens if you’re interrupted or have to switch quickly to another project, even just for a moment? You guessed it: that carefully built mental architecture collapses. It can take hours of work just to get back to the same state of awareness. That’s the cost. So minimize that waste by trying to do all at once those tasks that require a specific kind of concentration. Put those tasks into blocks of time where it’s possible to shut off your phone and put up a “Do not disturb!” sign.

Some research has actually been done that shows that multitasking not only wastes your time but makes you stupid. A study done at the University of London back in 20057 (admittedly, a very small non-peer-reviewed study, but still) measured how stupid multitasking can make you. Psychiatrist Glenn Wilson took four men and four women and tested their IQ under quiet conditions and distracting conditions (phones ringing, e-mail arriving). During the tests he measured the subjects’ skin conductance, heart rate, and blood pressure. And, interestingly, the mean IQ scores of the subjects dropped by more than ten points when in distracting environments. Even more interesting, the drop-off was worse for men than women. (Perhaps, for some reason, women are more habituated to distraction.)

### Half Done Isn’t Done at All

As I’ve mentioned, Scrum takes a lot of its thinking from the Japanese manufacturing model that was codified in the classic book Toyota Production System by Taiichi Ohno. In the United States this model has been interpreted as “Lean” manufacturing. Basically, the idea is to eliminate as much waste as possible on the factory floor. Now, most of us aren’t looking to improve flow through an automobile plant, but some of the ideas are applicable to any kind of work at all.

One idea I want to address here is called “Work in Process,” or sometimes just “inventory.” The idea is that it’s wasteful to have a bunch of stuff lying around that isn’t being used to build something. That stuff, whether it be car doors or widgets, actually costs money, and if it’s sitting around on the factory floor, it means that huge amounts of money are bound up in inventory that isn’t actually needed right then. This changes how you look at things that are in process. If, for example, all an auto company has is a bunch of half-built cars, it has expended a lot of money and effort but hasn’t created anything of real value. In Lean manufacturing, the idea is to minimize the amount of half-built stuff lying around.

As I’ve said, in Scrum there is a rhythm to the work. Every iteration, or Sprint, the team tries to get a number of things done. But that “Done” implies a complete, deliverable product that can be used by a customer. If something is half done at the end of the Sprint, you’re worse off than if you hadn’t started at all. You’ve expended resources, effort, and time and gotten nothing to a deliverable state. You have a half-constructed car. It might have been better to create something smaller—something that really works.

Jobs that aren’t done and products that aren’t being used are two aspects of the same thing: invested effort with no positive outcome. Don’t do it.

### Do It Right the First Time

In a Toyota plant when a problem shows up on the line, every worker has the ability to stop the whole line. When that happens, everyone swarms around where the line stopped—not to yell at the guy for stopping the line, but to fix whatever problem is there. They don’t want any cars coming out the other end with things that have to be fixed. They fix the problem once, and it’s solved forever. If they don’t, that same defect could go into hundreds of vehicles.

At European luxury-car makers there was a different way of doing things. At the end of the production line were dozens of people in white lab coats going around fixing all the problems. They made sure the car door had that BMW clunk when the door closed, or the engine purred with exactly the right tone. They made sure all the parts meshed together properly. They viewed themselves not as manufacturers but as craftsmen, artisans making a thing of beauty. That’s great when you’re making a few cars, but when you’re making millions, those costs add up. As Womack reports in his book:

> … the German plant was expending more effort to fix the problems it had just created than the Japanese plant required to make a nearly perfect car the first time.

You read that right. The Germans spent more time fixing a car they’d just made than the Japanese did making one in the first place. There’s a reason Toyota became the number one car manufacturer on the planet. They did it right the first time.

But we don’t always do things perfectly the first time. We’re human; we make mistakes. How you deal with those mistakes can have an extraordinary impact on how fast you can get things done, and at what level of quality. At Toyota, as I said, every worker in the factory can stop the line. The idea is that the process is being continuously improved, and that the right moment to fix a problem is when it is observed, not after the fact.

It took twenty-four times longer. If a bug was addressed on the day it was created, it would take an hour to fix; three weeks later, it would take twenty-four hours. It didn’t even matter if the bug was big or small, complicated or simple—it always took twenty-four times longer three weeks later. As you can imagine, every software developer in the company was soon required to test and fix their code on the same day.

The human mind has limits. We can only remember so many things; we can really only concentrate on one thing at a time. This tendency—for the process of fixing things to get harder as more time elapses—represents a similar limitation. When you’re working on a project, there’s a whole mind space that you create around it. You know all the different reasons why something is being done. You’re holding a pretty complicated construct in your head. Re-creating that construct a week later is hard. You have to remember all the factors that you were considering when you made that choice. You have to re-create the thought process that led you to that decision. You have to become your past self again, put yourself back inside a mind that no longer exists. Doing that takes time. A long time. Twenty-four times as long as it would take if you had fixed the problem when you first discovered it.

I’m sure you’ve had this experience yourself in your own work, and the lesson is one you were probably taught as a child: Do things right the first time. The only thing the data now adds is that if you do make a mistake—and we all make them—fix it as soon as you notice it. If you don’t, you’ll pay for it.
