The heart of Scrum is rhythm. Rhythm is deeply important to human beings. Its beat is heard in the thrumming of our blood and rooted in some of the deepest recesses of our brains. We’re pattern seekers, driven to seek out rhythm in all aspects of our lives.

However, the patterns we seek aren’t necessarily rewarding or optimized to bring us happiness. For example, there are the negative rhythms of the addict and the depressed. You can walk the halls of just about any office building and see these negative patterns made manifest. They’re likely to be found anywhere that someone feels frustrated at being stymied, or quietly desperate as it dawns on them that they’re trapped in an uncaring system, or angry at being viewed as a cog in a machine.

This is part of the human experience. You can go back thousands of years and read the writings of other people, just like us, whose lives were caught up in a system they felt helpless against. But we seem to have mastered that trapped feeling sometime during the twentieth century. Throughout the business environment especially, we created an acute depersonalization that seems dictated by fate.

What Scrum does is create a different kind of pattern. It accepts that we’re habit-driven creatures, seekers of rhythm, somewhat predictable, but also somewhat magical and capable of greatness. When I created Scrum, I thought, What if I can take human patterns and make them positive rather than negative? What if I can design a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle that encourages the best parts of ourselves and diminishes the worst? In giving Scrum a daily and weekly rhythm, I guess what I was striving for was to offer people the chance to like the person they see in the mirror.

But there are pitfalls. What look like virtuous patterns can end up being nothing but folly—nothing but waste. That’s what I’m going to spend this chapter talking about: the waste that infects our work, the cancer that eats at our productivity, our organizations, our lives, and our society.

I briefly introduced Toyota’s Taiichi Ohno in the first chapter of this book, where he said, “Waste is a crime against society more than a business loss.” His thoughts about waste deeply influenced mine, and I want to spend some time talking about them.

Ohno talked about three different types of waste. He used the Japanese words: Muri, waste through unreasonableness; Mura, waste through inconsistency; and Muda, waste through outcomes. These ideas are highly aligned with Deming’s PDCA cycle, which I wrote about earlier: Plan, Do, Check, Act. Plan means avoid Muri. Do means avoid Mura. Check means avoid Muda. Act means the will, motivation, and determination to do all that. I’m going to go through these steps one at a time and point out what to avoid—from waste in inventory, to the waste of not doing it right the first time, to the waste of working too hard, to the emotional waste of unreasonable expectations.

### Do One Thing at a Time

The ability to juggle seems so attractive—especially in an age in which information is flowing through a thousand different pipelines and “must do nows” are proliferating. We want to be that guy—the Super-Juggler. We tell ourselves we can. Unfortunately, we can’t. And the more we think we can, the worse we actually are at it.

“Here’s a quote from my favorite paper on the subject:

> … even when participants direct their gaze at objects in the driving environment, they often fail to “see” them when they are talking on a cell phone because attention has been directed away from the external environment and toward an internal, cognitive context associated with the phone conversation.

What does this mean when you’re trying to get things done? Well, let’s look at a typical team. This year they’ve decided to do three projects. Let’s call them A, B, and C. And they plan out their year, saying they’ll do a little bit on this project, then that one, and then the next one, so their calendar looks like what’s shown on this figure.

By trying to do everything at once—the classic strategy—completing those three projects will take them till the end of July. But by approaching the aggregate in a Scrum fashion, by driving each project to Done one at a time, they minimize the cost of context switching. They’re able to finish by the beginning of May.

They don’t change how big the project is, or what’s involved in creating it, but just by doing one thing exclusively before moving on, the work takes a little more than half as much time. Half.

And the other half? That’s pure waste. Not a thing more is produced. Not a dollar saved. Not a new innovation implemented. It is just a waste of human life. It’s working for no purpose.

So that’s the cost of multitasking. We all live in a world where there are multiple demands on our time. People want different things from us: the phone rings with a really important call, the kids arrive home from school, the boss walks into our office. What I want you to do, though, is be conscious of the cost of context switching. It’s very real, and you should try to minimize it.

If you’re working with something complicated—for example, writing a report, creating a presentation, developing a piece of software, or crafting a book, you’re holding an incredibly complex object in your mind. You must take into account dozens of factors, remember what you’ve done, where you want to go, and what the impediments might be. That’s a pretty tricky thing to do. And what happens if you’re interrupted or have to switch quickly to another project, even just for a moment? You guessed it: that carefully built mental architecture collapses. It can take hours of work just to get back to the same state of awareness. That’s the cost. So minimize that waste by trying to do all at once those tasks that require a specific kind of concentration. Put those tasks into blocks of time where it’s possible to shut off your phone and put up a “Do not disturb!” sign.

Some research has actually been done that shows that multitasking not only wastes your time but makes you stupid. A study done at the University of London back in 20057 (admittedly, a very small non-peer-reviewed study, but still) measured how stupid multitasking can make you. Psychiatrist Glenn Wilson took four men and four women and tested their IQ under quiet conditions and distracting conditions (phones ringing, e-mail arriving). During the tests he measured the subjects’ skin conductance, heart rate, and blood pressure. And, interestingly, the mean IQ scores of the subjects dropped by more than ten points when in distracting environments. Even more interesting, the drop-off was worse for men than women. (Perhaps, for some reason, women are more habituated to distraction.)
