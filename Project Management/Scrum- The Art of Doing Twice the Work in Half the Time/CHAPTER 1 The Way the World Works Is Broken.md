### A New Way of Thinking

I called this framework for team performance “Scrum.” The term comes from the game of rugby, and it refers to the way a team works together to move the ball down the field. Careful alignment, unity of purpose, and clarity of goal come together. It’s the perfect metaphor for what I want teams to do.

Traditionally, management wants two things on any project: control and predictability. This leads to vast numbers of documents and graphs and charts. Months of effort go into planning every detail, so there will be no mistakes, no cost overruns, and things will be delivered on schedule.

The problem is that the rosy scenario never actually unfolds. All that effort poured into planning, trying to restrict change, trying to know the unknowable is wasted. Every project involves discovery of problems and bursts of inspiration. Trying to restrict a human endeavor of any scope to color-coded charts and graphs is foolish and doomed to failure. It’s not how people work, and it’s not how projects progress. It’s not how ideas reach fruition or how great things are made.

Instead, it leads to frustrated people not getting what they want. Projects are delayed, come in over budget, and, in too many cases, end in abject failure. This is especially true for teams involved in the creative work of crafting something new. Most of the time, management won’t learn of the glide path toward failure until millions of dollars and thousands of hours have been invested for naught.

Scrum asks why it takes so long and so much effort to do stuff, and why we’re so bad at figuring out how long and how much effort things will take. 

Scrum embraces uncertainty and creativity. It places a structure around the learning process, enabling teams to assess both what they’ve created and, just as important, how they created it. The Scrum framework harnesses how teams actually work and gives them the tools to self-organize and rapidly improve both speed and quality of work.

At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in, see if what you’re doing is heading in the right direction, and if it’s actually what people want? And question whether there are any ways to improve how you’re doing what you’re doing, any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from doing that.

That’s what’s called an “Inspect and Adapt” cycle. Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing, review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and how you might do it better. It’s a simple idea, but executing it requires thought, introspection, honesty, and discipline.

The end results of Scrum—the design goal, if you will—are teams that dramatically improve their productivity. 

In software development there is a rule, borne out by decades of research, that 80 percent of the value in any piece of software is in 20 percent of the features.

Making people prioritize by value forces them to produce that 20 percent first. Often by the time they’re done, they realize they don’t really need the other 80 percent, or that what seemed important at the outset actually isn’t.

The use of the phrase “agile methodology” shows just how little the IG knew about Scrum. The term “Agile” dates back to a 2001 conclave where I and sixteen other leaders in software development wrote up what has become known as the “Agile Manifesto.” It declared the following values: people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what that product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan. Scrum is the framework I built to put those values into practice. There is no methodology.

It was also crucial, of course, that team members figure out what would stop them from accelerating. As Jeff Johnson put it, “I handled “impediment removal.” An “impediment” is an idea that comes from the company that first formed a lot of the ideas Scrum is based on: Toyota. And, more specifically, Taiichi Ohno’s Toyota Production System.

I won’t go into all the details here, but one of the key concepts that Ohno introduced is the idea of “flow.” That is, production should flow swiftly and calmly throughout the process, and, he said, one of management’s key tasks is to identify and remove impediments to that flow. Everything that stands in the way is waste. Ohno gives waste a moral, as well as a business, value in his classic book, The Toyota Production System:

> It is not an exaggeration that in a low-growth period such waste is a crime against society more than a business loss. Eliminating waste must be a business’s first objective.”

It took the Sentinel team about three months to figure out how long completing the project would really take. Why? This goes back to that “Inspect and Adapt” cycle I talked about earlier. Scrum works by setting sequential goals that must be completed in a fixed length of time. In the FBI’s case, they decided on two-week cycles, with the understanding that, at the end of each cycle, there would be a finished increment of product. That meant they’d have something working, something that could be shown to anyone who cared to look but certainly the stakeholders and, optimally, the people who’d actually be using the thing.

This methodology allows teams to get near real-time feedback on their work. Are they headed in the right direction? Is what they’re planning to do next really what they should be doing, given what they’ve discovered during that cycle?

In Scrum we call these cycles “Sprints.” At the beginning of each cycle there is a meeting to plan the Sprint. The team decides how much work they think they can accomplish during the next two weeks. They’ll take the work items off that prioritized list of things that need to be done and often just write them out on sticky notes and put them on the wall. The team decides how many of those work items they can get done during this Sprint.

At the end of the Sprint, the team comes together and shows what they’ve accomplished during the time they’ve collaborated. They look at how many of those sticky notes they actually got done. Did they bring too many into the Sprint and not finish them all? Did they not bring enough? What’s important here is that they begin to have a baseline sense of how fast they can go—their velocity.

After they’ve shown what they’ve done—and here’s where Ohno’s ideas come in—they discuss not what they did, but how they did it. They ask, “How can we work together better in the next Sprint? What was getting in our way during the last one? What are the impediments that are slowing our velocity?” You can find a more detailed explanation of how Scrum works in the appendix.

And that’s why Jeff Johnson needed a few months before he could really tell how long the project would take. He wanted to measure the velocity of each team measured over a few Sprints and then see how much they could improve—how much faster they could go. Once he looked at how many work items each team had finished in each Sprint and then checked how many they had remaining until the end of the project, he could forecast a completion date.

Besides learning how fast the teams were going, he also wanted to know what impediments were slowing them down. What he really wanted to do was accelerate those teams so they were producing faster—not by working longer hours (I’ll go into why that’s a fruitless rat hole that ends up making things take longer later) but by working better and smarter. Jeff Johnson says his teams increased their productivity by a factor of three. They were going three times as fast once they got moving as compared to when they started. Why? They got better at working together, yes, but most important, they figured out the things that were slowing them down, and each cycle, each Sprint, they’d try to get rid of them.

And the most powerful part of Scrum from his point of view? “Demos. Driving toward a demonstrable product on a frequent basis.” Every two weeks the Sentinel team would demonstrate what they’d accomplished. And this show-and-tell wasn’t just to themselves. They were taking what they’d achieved and running it by the people who would actually be using the system. Everyone who had a stake in the project sent someone and that could make for a pretty full house. 

And that was what made it work, says Johnson. “Scrum is not about the developers. It’s about the customers and stakeholders. Really, it was an organizational change. Showing the actual product was the most powerful part.”

Jeff told his team about a passage he had to memorize when he was a Naval cadet at Annapolis. It was from Teddy Roosevelt’s speech “Citizenship in a Republic,” which he gave at the Sorbonne in 1910. It is oft-quoted, and you may be already familiar with it:

>  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

There’s an old joke in the Scrum community. A chicken and a pig are walking down the road, and the chicken says, “Hey, Pig, I was thinking we should open up a restaurant.”

“What should we call it?” asks the pig.

“How about ‘Ham and Eggs’?”

“No thanks,” says the pig. “I’d be committed, but you’d only be involved!”

The idea in Scrum is that the “pigs” are the ones who are totally committed to the project and are responsible for its outcome. The “chickens” are the people who are informed of its progress, the stakeholders.

# THE TAKEAWAY

* Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid. It’s just so tempting to draw up endless charts. All the work needed to be done on a massive project laid out for everyone to see—but when detailed plans meet reality, they fall apart. Build into your working method the assumption of change, discovery, and new ideas.  
* Inspect and Adapt. Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing, review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and if you can do it better.  
* Change or Die. Clinging to the old way of doing things, of command and control and rigid predictability, will bring only failure. In the meantime, the competition that is willing to change will leave you in the dust.  
* Fail Fast So You Can Fix Early. Corporate culture often puts more weight on forms, procedures, and meetings than on visible value creation that can be inspected at short intervals by users. Work that does not produce real value is madness. Working product in short cycles allows early user feedback and you can immediately eliminate what is obviously wasteful effort.
