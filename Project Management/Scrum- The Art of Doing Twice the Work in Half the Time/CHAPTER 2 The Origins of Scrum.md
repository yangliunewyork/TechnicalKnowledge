### Learning to Think Like a Robot

Here was something that was doing exactly what I was trained to do flying in Vietnam: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. It was taking in its environment and behaving decisively based on the data from that environment.

“What would happen,” I asked Brooks, “if we could come up with a simple instruction set for teams of people to work together just like those legs? They would self-organize and self-optimize, just like that robot.”

“I don’t know,” he replied. “Why don’t you try it and let me know how it works out?”

### Don’t Go Chasing Waterfalls

Then one day, one of the developers came in with a Harvard Business Review paper from 1986, written by two Japanese business professors, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. It was titled, “The New New Product Development Game.” Takeuchi and Nonaka had looked at teams from some of the world’s most productive and innovative companies: Honda, Fuji-Xerox, 3M, Hewlett-Packard, and others. They argued that the old way of doing product development, typified by NASA’s Phased Program Planning system—a Waterfall system—was fundamentally flawed. Instead, the best companies used an overlapping development process that was faster and more flexible. The teams were cross-functional. The teams had autonomy. They were empowered to make their own decisions. And they had a transcendent purpose. They were reaching for something bigger than themselves. Management didn’t dictate. Instead, executives were servant-leaders and facilitators focused on getting obstacles out of their teams’ way rather than telling them what and how to do product development. The Japanese professors compared the teams’ work to that of a rugby team and said the best teams acted as though they were in a scrum: “…  the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field.

Takeuchi and Nonaka’s paper made a splash when it was first published, but that was seven years before we were reading the paper at Easel. Everyone had admired it, but no one had done anything with it. The average American manager was unable to make sense of it even though Toyota was rapidly increasing market share using this approach. At Easel we had nothing to lose. We decided to try it, even though the paper focused on manufacturing, not software development. I thought their ideas tapped into something fundamental, a descriptive process of how humans work together best in any endeavor. It flowed into all the other experiments I’d conducted, going back to my first job in the private sector at MidContinent.

This was the formal birth of “Scrum.” We delivered the product at Easel on schedule within six months, under budget, and with fewer bugs than any previous delivery.

I got so excited about the possibilities of this new form of project management that all my future work focused on refining Scrum for companies. In 1995 I presented a paper with Ken Schwaber, called “SCRUM Development Process,” which codified those practices at an Association for Computing Machinery research conference. Since then we have dropped the all-caps and tweaked the idea a little bit, but the fundamental principles are the same—and those companies that embrace the process typically see immediate benefits.

# THE TAKEAWAY

* Hesitation Is Death. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. Know where you are, assess your options, make a decision, and act!
* Look Outward for Answers. Complex adaptive systems follow a few simple rules, which they learn from their environment.
* Great Teams Are. They are cross-functional, autonomous, and empowered, with a transcendent purpose.
* Don’t Guess. Plan, Do, Check, Act. Plan what you’re going to do. Do it. Check whether it did what you wanted. Act on that and change how you’re doing things. Repeat in regular cycles, and, by doing so, achieve continuous improvement.
* Shu Ha Ri. First, learn the rules and the forms, and once you’ve mastered them, make innovations. Finally, in a heightened state of mastery, discard the forms and just be—with all the learning internalized and decisions made almost unconsciously.
