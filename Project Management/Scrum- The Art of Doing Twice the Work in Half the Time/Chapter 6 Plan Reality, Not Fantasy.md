### Size Does Matter, but Only Relatively  

So that’s relative sizing, comparing tasks to one another. Now, we don’t all use dogs, unfortunately, but you might have noticed a pattern there in the numbers I assigned: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13. Each number in the series is the sum of the two previous numbers. It’s called the “Fibonacci sequence,” and there’s a reason we use it. It is everywhere.

The sequence is how nature lays itself out, whether it be in the shell of a nautilus, the branches on a tree, the bumps on a pineapple, or the petals of a pinecone. It shows up in cauliflower and the curves of the human brain. It’s the same whether you’re looking at the curl of a fern leaf or the shape of a galaxy. It’s one of those phenomena that, when you think about it, is pretty freaky.

There’s a name for this phenomenon—it’s called the “Golden Mean” or the “Golden Ratio.” We’ve built it into buildings and art. From the Parthenon in Athens to the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia. We’ve used it to decide the size and shape of pages in a book and the proportions of playing cards. Humans are just programmed to find the ratios attractive. For our purposes, all that’s important to know is that our species deeply understands the ratios of the Fibonacci sequence. We know them in our bones.

The numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are far enough apart that we can easily tell the difference. It’s easy for people to come down on one side or the other. If one person estimates something as a five, and another as an eight, we can intuitively see the difference. But the difference between a five and a six? That’s pretty subtle, more than our brains can really register.

It’s fairly well-known in medicine that for patients to report they perceive an improvement in a symptom, it has to have been a greater than 65-percent improvement. Our minds don’t work in smooth increments. We’re better at perceiving jumps from one state to another—and not smooth jumps but jagged ones.

What using the Fibonacci sequence to calculate task size permits is estimates that don’t have to be 100 percent accurate. Nothing will be exactly a five or an eight or a thirteen, but using those numbers gives us a way to collect opinions on the size of a task where everyone is using roughly the same measuring stick, and in that way a consensus is formed.

Estimating as a group in this manner gives us a far more accurate estimate than we could come up with alone.

### The Oracle of Delphi

> 在3000年前，希腊德尔斐神庙阿波罗神殿门前的那三句石刻铭文：“认识你自己”、“凡事勿过度”、“承诺带来痛苦”。这句话曾引起过无数智者的深思，后来被奉为“德尔斐神谕”。

So now we know we’re good at comparing one thing to another. And we know the best ratio to utilize for the task. But how do we get there? A list of prioritized things to do is all well and good, but how do we figure out which story is a five and which is an eight; which is a goldie and which is a schnauzer? And even if one person has a pretty good idea, how do we make sure her estimates line up with everyone else’s? What if she isn’t taking some key factors into account?

Unsurprisingly, this is not a new problem. People have struggled for decades with exactly this. One issue is that different members of the team know different things, but another is sometimes called the “bandwagon” effect. You’ve been in meetings like that. That’s when someone comes up with an idea, and everyone starts talking about it. And even if you disagreed with it initially, you go along because the group is going along. And everyone agrees on a path forward that seems like a really good idea at the time but turns out to be a complete failure. And when you probe people about the decision, it’s almost always the case that each had some reservations, but they didn’t voice them because they figured everyone else was excited. People assume that if everyone else is going along with something, their own reservation is silly or misinformed, and they don’t want to look stupid in front of the group. Remember, this groupthink isn’t an individual failure; this is a human failure.

In the literature this effect has been explained as an “informational cascade.” As Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer, and Ivo Welch, the authors of the paper “A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades” put it: “An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.”

> An information cascade is a situation where each person makes a decision/choice based on the observations or choices of others while ignoring his own personal information. Information cascade is a theory used in the field of behavioral economics as well as other social sciences. Informational cascades can be observed in various scenarios including financial markets, politics, and business strategies.“信息流瀑”（information cascade）。信息流瀑指的是个人处在一群人当中，有意或无意地接受别人的影响。不管自己有没有想法，都跟着别人学样。所学之样可以是直接模仿，也可以是凭猜测来推断别人的意思。

A great example the authors use is the submission of a paper to a journal. Let’s say the first journal’s editor rejects it. Then the writer submits the same article to a second journal. That journal’s editor, learning of the first rejection, is more likely to reject it. And if there’s a third journal, that editor, knowing of the two previous rejections, is even more likely to reject it. People assume other people are making sound judgments, even if those judgments contradict their own. This is bad. When you’re making a judgment about when you’ll likely deliver a multibillion-dollar project—or whether you’ll get everything done on time for your wedding day—it’s critical to apply your own judgment, and use other estimates to improve your own, not replace it.

The other well-known problem is what’s called the “halo effect.” This is when one characteristic of something influences how people perceive other, unrelated characteristics. This was first empirically studied in 1920 by Edward Lee Thorndike. In his classic paper “A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings,” Thorndike asked military officers to rank their soldiers by various qualities—physical, intellectual, leadership, personality, and so on. He then looked at how one set of qualities affected the rating of another. He found that they correlated too closely. If someone’s physique was rated highly, so were his leadership skills. And his intelligence. And his character. This research has been supported in follow-up studies over the years, confirming that, for example, if someone is good-looking, everyone assumes that they’re also smart and trustworthy.
