### Size Does Matter, but Only Relatively  

So that’s relative sizing, comparing tasks to one another. Now, we don’t all use dogs, unfortunately, but you might have noticed a pattern there in the numbers I assigned: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13. Each number in the series is the sum of the two previous numbers. It’s called the “Fibonacci sequence,” and there’s a reason we use it. It is everywhere.

The sequence is how nature lays itself out, whether it be in the shell of a nautilus, the branches on a tree, the bumps on a pineapple, or the petals of a pinecone. It shows up in cauliflower and the curves of the human brain. It’s the same whether you’re looking at the curl of a fern leaf or the shape of a galaxy. It’s one of those phenomena that, when you think about it, is pretty freaky.

There’s a name for this phenomenon—it’s called the “Golden Mean” or the “Golden Ratio.” We’ve built it into buildings and art. From the Parthenon in Athens to the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia. We’ve used it to decide the size and shape of pages in a book and the proportions of playing cards. Humans are just programmed to find the ratios attractive. For our purposes, all that’s important to know is that our species deeply understands the ratios of the Fibonacci sequence. We know them in our bones.

The numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are far enough apart that we can easily tell the difference. It’s easy for people to come down on one side or the other. If one person estimates something as a five, and another as an eight, we can intuitively see the difference. But the difference between a five and a six? That’s pretty subtle, more than our brains can really register.

It’s fairly well-known in medicine that for patients to report they perceive an improvement in a symptom, it has to have been a greater than 65-percent improvement. Our minds don’t work in smooth increments. We’re better at perceiving jumps from one state to another—and not smooth jumps but jagged ones.

What using the Fibonacci sequence to calculate task size permits is estimates that don’t have to be 100 percent accurate. Nothing will be exactly a five or an eight or a thirteen, but using those numbers gives us a way to collect opinions on the size of a task where everyone is using roughly the same measuring stick, and in that way a consensus is formed.

Estimating as a group in this manner gives us a far more accurate estimate than we could come up with alone.

### The Oracle of Delphi

> 在3000年前，希腊德尔斐神庙阿波罗神殿门前的那三句石刻铭文：“认识你自己”、“凡事勿过度”、“承诺带来痛苦”。这句话曾引起过无数智者的深思，后来被奉为“德尔斐神谕”。

So now we know we’re good at comparing one thing to another. And we know the best ratio to utilize for the task. But how do we get there? A list of prioritized things to do is all well and good, but how do we figure out which story is a five and which is an eight; which is a goldie and which is a schnauzer? And even if one person has a pretty good idea, how do we make sure her estimates line up with everyone else’s? What if she isn’t taking some key factors into account?

Unsurprisingly, this is not a new problem. People have struggled for decades with exactly this. One issue is that different members of the team know different things, but another is sometimes called the “bandwagon” effect. You’ve been in meetings like that. That’s when someone comes up with an idea, and everyone starts talking about it. And even if you disagreed with it initially, you go along because the group is going along. And everyone agrees on a path forward that seems like a really good idea at the time but turns out to be a complete failure. And when you probe people about the decision, it’s almost always the case that each had some reservations, but they didn’t voice them because they figured everyone else was excited. People assume that if everyone else is going along with something, their own reservation is silly or misinformed, and they don’t want to look stupid in front of the group. Remember, this groupthink isn’t an individual failure; this is a human failure.

In the literature this effect has been explained as an “informational cascade.” As Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer, and Ivo Welch, the authors of the paper “A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades” put it: “An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information.”

> An information cascade is a situation where each person makes a decision/choice based on the observations or choices of others while ignoring his own personal information. Information cascade is a theory used in the field of behavioral economics as well as other social sciences. Informational cascades can be observed in various scenarios including financial markets, politics, and business strategies.“信息流瀑”（information cascade）。信息流瀑指的是个人处在一群人当中，有意或无意地接受别人的影响。不管自己有没有想法，都跟着别人学样。所学之样可以是直接模仿，也可以是凭猜测来推断别人的意思。

A great example the authors use is the submission of a paper to a journal. Let’s say the first journal’s editor rejects it. Then the writer submits the same article to a second journal. That journal’s editor, learning of the first rejection, is more likely to reject it. And if there’s a third journal, that editor, knowing of the two previous rejections, is even more likely to reject it. People assume other people are making sound judgments, even if those judgments contradict their own. This is bad. When you’re making a judgment about when you’ll likely deliver a multibillion-dollar project—or whether you’ll get everything done on time for your wedding day—it’s critical to apply your own judgment, and use other estimates to improve your own, not replace it.

The other well-known problem is what’s called the “halo effect.” This is when one characteristic of something influences how people perceive other, unrelated characteristics. This was first empirically studied in 1920 by Edward Lee Thorndike. In his classic paper “A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings,” Thorndike asked military officers to rank their soldiers by various qualities—physical, intellectual, leadership, personality, and so on. He then looked at how one set of qualities affected the rating of another. He found that they correlated too closely. If someone’s physique was rated highly, so were his leadership skills. And his intelligence. And his character. This research has been supported in follow-up studies over the years, confirming that, for example, if someone is good-looking, everyone assumes that they’re also smart and trustworthy.

### Planning Poker

So the advantage of Delphi is that it takes a broad array of opinions, attempts to remove as much bias as possible, and with informed, yet anonymous, statements narrows down opinions into a generally accepted estimate. The bad part, for our purposes, is that it takes a long time. When I sat down with the teams at Medco, I didn’t spend any time with anonymous surveys. I wanted all those hundreds of items estimated within hours, not days, and certainly not weeks.

Fortunately, there is a way of gathering estimates that is fairly quick and accurate. It’s called “Planning Poker.”

The idea is simple. Each person has a deck of cards with those oh-so-interesting Fibonacci numbers on them—1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. Each item that needs to be estimated is brought to the table. Then everyone pulls the card they think represents the right amount of effort and puts it facedown on the table. At the same time everyone flips the cards over. If everyone is within two cards of each other (say a five, two eights, and a thirteen), the team just adds them all up and takes the average (in that case 6.6) and moves on to the next item. Remember, we’re talking estimates, not ironbound schedules. And estimates on small pieces of the project.

If people are more than three cards apart, then the high and the low cards talk about why they think what they do. Then everyone does another round of Planning Poker. Otherwise they just average the estimates, which will approximate the numbers that the statisticians at the Rand Corporation came up with.

This incredibly simple method is a way to avoid any kind of anchoring behavior, such as the bandwagon or halo effects, and it allows the whole team to share knowledge on a particular task. It’s crucial, though, that you have the team who’s actually doing the work do the estimating, not some expert “ideal” estimators.

What I took away from that was that only the people doing the work know how long and how much effort it will take. Maybe their team is really good at one kind of thing but terrible at another. Maybe they have one expert who can be helpful in a particular area, but no one on the team knows about a different area. Teams, as I’ve discussed before, are individual and unique. Each has its own pace and rhythm. Forcing them into cookie-cutter processes is a recipe for disaster.

### There Are No Tasks; There Are Only Stories

How many times at work have you been given a job where you don’t understand the reason you’re doing it? Someone asks you to determine how much sales changed from month to month in Region A, looking at stores with more than 600 square feet. You do it, but you don’t know why it needs to be done. And because of that, you might provide the wrong kind of data, you might misinterpret the question, or you might just get resentful at being given a bunch of what seems like busywork. Or if you’re the manager, you might be astounded that your people don’t understand immediately that you’re looking at closing down small stores and opening up big ones.

The problem is that you’re not getting, or giving, enough information to actually do the job right. People think in narratives, in stories. That’s how we understand the world. We have an intimate grasp of characters, desires, and motivations. Where we get into trouble is when we try to abstract out of the main through-line discrete parts and deal with them out of context.

So the first thing you want to think about when you’re considering a task is character or role—for example, a customer, a bride, a reader, an employee. Who is this task being done for? Whose lens on the world is the one we need to gaze through when we’re building this thing, making that decision, or delivering this piece?

Then you need to think of the what—what we want done in the first place. This is usually where we start and stop. But it’s only the middle of the process we should be following.

Finally, you need to think of motivation. Why does this character want this thing? How is it going to serve and delight this particular customer? And, in a way, this is the key part. Motivation colors everything.

Often, needs will change with different characters. Imagine, for example, a story with the back two-thirds: “…  I want a car so that I can drive to work.” Now, if you start that sentence with “As a suburban commuter …” versus “As a farmer in the South Dakota Badlands … ,” you are going to end up with a very different interpretation of what the ideal vehicle is.

So before you prioritize what needs to be done for your business, you need to define the character, the user, the customer—the person who’s going to use what you’re going to do. You need to know their likes, dislikes, passions, enthusiasms, frustrations, and joys. And then you need to understand their motivations. How do those character types feed what they want? Why do they need a car? What are they going to do with that captain’s log?

This will also influence how you’ll estimate things. Oh, they want a simple calendar function; that’s easy. An unalterable time stamp for legal purposes—that’s a bit trickier.

### Write Short Stories

When you’re writing your stories, though, you want to make sure that they’re small enough that you can actually estimate them. Imagine the story about Amazon.com: As a customer, I want the world’s biggest online bookseller so that I can buy any book I want at any time I want. Now, that certainly encapsulates Amazon, but it’s really too big to actually do anything with. You need to break it down. Really down.

You might write stories like these for an online bookstore:

“As a customer, I want to be able to browse books by genre, so that I can find the type of books I like.”

“As a customer, I want to put a book into a shopping cart, so that I can buy it.”

“As a product manager, I want to be able to track a customer’s purchases, so that I can market specific books to her based on past purchases.”

Those stories are ones that a team can wrap its head around. A discussion can actually ensue about how to implement them. They’re specific enough to be actionable but don’t prescribe how they’re going to be done. Remember, the team decides how the work will be accomplished, but what will be accomplished is decided by business value. The whole collection of stories that might make up that idea of an online bookstore is often referred to as an “Epic”—a story too big to do by itself but that includes a number of smaller stories that add up to a single idea.

### Be Ready and Be Done

When you’re writing stories or making a list of work to be done, it’s important to ask two questions: Is the story ready? And how will you know when it’s done?

Let’s take Tim’s story as an example:

As a Special Forces medic, I must teach basic physiology to my students, so they can understand the human body.

There is a mnemonic I always use to tell whether a story is ready. It was created by Bill Wake, who’s a deep thinker on software design. Bill says that for any story to be ready it needs to meet the INVEST criteria:

* Independent. The story must be actionable and “completable” on its own. It shouldn’t be inherently dependent on another story.  
* Negotiable. Until it’s actually being done, it needs to be able to be rewritten. Allowance for change is built in.  
* Valuable. It actually delivers value to a customer or user or stakeholder.  
* Estimable. You have to be able to size it.  
* Small. The story needs to be small enough to be able to estimate and plan for easily. If it is too big, rewrite it or break it down into smaller stories.  
* Testable. The story must have a test it is supposed to pass in order to be complete. Write the test before you do the story.  

For each story pursued there should be both a “definition of Ready” (as in “Does it meet the INVEST criteria?”) and finally “a definition of Done” (as in “What conditions need to be met, what tests need to be passed, to call it a wrap?”). We find in real projects that if stories are really Ready, the team will double the speed of implementation. And if the stories are really Done at the end of a Sprint, teams can double speed again. This is one of the tricks needed to get twice as much work done in half the time.
