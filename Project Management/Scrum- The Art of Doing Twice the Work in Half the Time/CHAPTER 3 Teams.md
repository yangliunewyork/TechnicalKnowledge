In their original paper that described what became Scrum, “The New New Product Development Game,” Professors Takeuchi and Nonaka described the characteristics of the teams they saw at the best companies in the world:

1. Transcendent: They have a sense of purpose beyond the ordinary. This self-realized goal allows them to move beyond the ordinary into the extraordinary. In a very real way the very decision to not be average, but to be great, changes the way they view themselves, and what they’re capable of.  
2. Autonomous: The teams are self-organizing and self-managing, they have the power to make their own decisions about how they do their jobs, and are empowered to make those decisions stick.  
3. Cross-Functional: The teams have all the skills needed to complete the project. Planning, design, production, sales, distribution. And those skills feed and reinforce each other. As one team member that designed a revolutionary new camera for Canon described it: “When all the team members are located in one large room, someone’s information becomes yours, without even trying. You then start thinking in terms of what’s best or second best for the group at large and not only where you stand.  

### Scrum in the Time of Revolt

One of the key concepts in Scrum is that the team members decide themselves how they’re going to do the work. It’s management’s responsibility to set the strategic goals, but it’s the team’s job to decide how to reach those goals.

They succeeded by using Scrum. Their deadlines called for them to report every twelve hours, on Morning Edition and All Things Considered. Each cycle J.J. would talk to the team and ask three very simple questions: What did you do since the last time we talked? What are you going to do before we talk again? And what is getting in your way? His asking those questions, which is one of the regular rituals of Scrum, forced the correspondents to talk and share with one another. And J.J.’s main job, as de facto Scrum Master, was to make sure that those things getting in the team’s way at one meeting were gone by the next.
