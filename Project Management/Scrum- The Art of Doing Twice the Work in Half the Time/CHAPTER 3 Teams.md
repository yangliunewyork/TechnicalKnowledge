In their original paper that described what became Scrum, “The New New Product Development Game,” Professors Takeuchi and Nonaka described the characteristics of the teams they saw at the best companies in the world:

1. Transcendent: They have a sense of purpose beyond the ordinary. This self-realized goal allows them to move beyond the ordinary into the extraordinary. In a very real way the very decision to not be average, but to be great, changes the way they view themselves, and what they’re capable of.  
2. Autonomous: The teams are self-organizing and self-managing, they have the power to make their own decisions about how they do their jobs, and are empowered to make those decisions stick.  
3. Cross-Functional: The teams have all the skills needed to complete the project. Planning, design, production, sales, distribution. And those skills feed and reinforce each other. As one team member that designed a revolutionary new camera for Canon described it: “When all the team members are located in one large room, someone’s information becomes yours, without even trying. You then start thinking in terms of what’s best or second best for the group at large and not only where you stand.  

### Scrum in the Time of Revolt

One of the key concepts in Scrum is that the team members decide themselves how they’re going to do the work. It’s management’s responsibility to set the strategic goals, but it’s the team’s job to decide how to reach those goals.

They succeeded by using Scrum. Their deadlines called for them to report every twelve hours, on Morning Edition and All Things Considered. Each cycle J.J. would talk to the team and ask three very simple questions: What did you do since the last time we talked? What are you going to do before we talk again? And what is getting in your way? His asking those questions, which is one of the regular rituals of Scrum, forced the correspondents to talk and share with one another. And J.J.’s main job, as de facto Scrum Master, was to make sure that those things getting in the team’s way at one meeting were gone by the next. 

### Size Does Matter, but Not the Way You Think

The team dynamic only works well in small teams. The classic formulation is seven people, plus or minus two, though I’ve seen teams as small as three function at a high level. What’s fascinating is that the data shows that if you have more than nine people on a team, their velocity actually slows down. That’s right. More resources make the team go slower.

In software development there’s a term called “Brooks’s Law” that Fred Brooks first coined back in 1975 in his seminal book The Mythical Man-Month. Put simply, Brooks’s Law says “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”8 This has been borne out in study after study. Lawrence Putnam is a legendary figure in software development, and he has made it his life’s work to study how long things take to make and why. His work kept showing that projects with twenty or more people on them used more effort than those with five or fewer. Not just a little bit, but a lot. A large team would take about five times the number of hours that a small team would. He saw this again and again, and in the mid-1990s he decided to try to do a broad-based study to determine what the right team size is. So he looked at 491 medium-size projects at hundreds of different companies. These were all projects that required new products or features to be created, not a repurposing of old versions. He divided the projects by team size and noticed something right away. Once the teams grew larger than eight, they took dramatically longer to get things done. Groups made up of three to seven people required about 25 percent of the effort of groups of nine to twenty to get the same amount of work done. This result recurred over hundreds and hundreds of projects. That very large groups do less seems to be an ironclad rule of human nature.

But why? To answer that, we have to look at the limitations of the human brain. You’ve probably heard of the classic George Miller study in 1956 showing that the maximum number of items the average person can retain in their short-term memory is seven. This is supposedly why telephone numbers are seven numbers long. The problem with Miller’s work is that later research has proved him wrong.

In 2001, Nelson Cowan of the University of Missouri wondered whether that magic rule of seven was really true and conducted a wide survey of all the new research on the topic. It turns out that the number of items one can retain in short-term memory isn’t seven. It’s four.

So there’s a hardwired limit to what our brain can hold at any one time. Which leads us back to Brooks. When he tried to figure out why adding more people to a project made it take longer, he discovered two reasons. The first is the time it takes to bring people up to speed. As you’d expect, bringing a new person up to speed slows down everyone else. The second reason has to do not only with how we think but, quite literally, with what our brains are capable of thinking. The number of communication channels increases dramatically with the number of people, and our brains just can’t handle it.

Just as on a Special Forces team, everyone on a Scrum team has to know what everyone else is doing. All the work being done, the challenges faced, the progress made, has to be transparent to everyone else. And if the team gets too big, the ability of everyone to communicate clearly with everyone else, all the time, gets muddled. There are too many crosscurrents. Often, the team socially and functionally breaks into sub-teams that begin working at cross-purposes. The cross-functionality is lost. Meetings that took minutes now take hours.

Don’t do it. Keep your teams small.

### The Scrum Master

They came up with four aspects worthy of emulation. The first was intense focus on the goal, built up and energized by the Maori chant. The second was radical collaboration—arms and bodies locked together, pushing for the same goal. The third was hunger to crush—anything in their way was to be obliterated. The fourth was universal excitement when any team member broke through with the ball. Who it was didn’t matter. That it happened was cause for celebration.

So we set up this framework of Sprints and Daily Stand-up meetings and Reviews and Retrospectives, and I realized we needed someone whose job it was to make sure the process itself was effective. Not a manager—more of a servant-leader, something between a team captain and a coach. As we were watching the All Blacks every day, I asked the team what we should call this person. They decided on “Scrum Master.” He or she would facilitate all the meetings, make sure there was transparency, and, most important, help the team discover what was getting in their way. The key part of that was to realize that often the impediments aren’t simply that the machine doesn’t work or that Jim in accounting is a jerk—it’s the process itself. It was the Scrum Master’s job to guide the team toward continuous improvement—to ask with regularity, “How can we do what we do better?”

Ideally, at the end of each iteration, each Sprint, the team would look closely at itself—at its interactions, practices, and processes—and ask two questions: “What can we change about how we work?” and “What is our biggest sticking point?” If those questions are answered forthrightly, a team can go faster than anyone ever imagined.

### Don’t Hate the Player, Hate the Game


The authors of Induction draw an interesting parallel between how we think mistakenly about social motivations and how nonscientists or people with merely an intuitive understanding of physics view the physical world.

An intuitive physicist might explain why a rock falls by saying the rock itself has the intrinsic quality of gravity, rather than saying that gravity is part of a system of forces acting on the rock. In the same way, when we talk about others, we talk about their inherent properties, rather than see those properties in relation to the external environment. In fact, it’s those interactions with our environment that drive our behavior. It’s the system that surrounds us, rather than any intrinsic quality, that accounts for the vast majority of our behavior. What Scrum is designed to do is change that system. Instead of looking for blame and fault, it rewards positive behavior by focusing people on working together and getting things done.

One of the most persistent questions surrounding the Holocaust was how so many millions of people could have been willing accomplices in such horror. Were Germans fundamentally morally reprehensible? Was there something intrinsically evil within their cultural makeup? Or were they really just following orders? It’s very easy to look at crimes against humanity and blame individuals for their actions. It’s the right thing to do, no? The question that Milgram wanted to answer, though, is: Are ordinary Americans so different from Germans? Would they have reacted differently in the same situation? And the uncomfortable answer is that no, Americans wouldn’t have behaved differently. In fact, given how many countries and cultures have replicated the experiment, no one would have. Given the right situation, we’re all capable of being Nazis.

Milgram summarized the implications this way in his 1974 article “The Perils of Obedience”:

> Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.

When this experiment is discussed in classrooms, it is usually pointed out to students that it is the system within which those ordinary people were operating that was the culprit, rather than the people themselves. But it’s a hard lesson to internalize, because if you accept the truth of that, what does it say about you?

What it says is that we’re all creatures of the system we find ourselves embedded in. What Scrum does is accept this reality, and, instead of seeking someone to blame, it tries to examine the system that produced the failure and fix it.

Yet people want to blame individuals, not systems. It just feels better. The Fundamental Attribution Error appeals to our sense of justice. If we can blame someone else, we insulate ourselves from the possibility that we’d do the same thing—that we’re just as likely to press that button as anyone else, given the right circumstances.


### Reaching “Great”

When a team starts to align and synchronize, it can seem magical. You feel it when you walk into a room with them. You see it as they take the field. They look as if they’re floating; they’ve become greater than themselves.

I was at a friend’s house recently in Copenhagen. As you can imagine, since he’s European, he’s a major soccer fan. I’m not sure what tournament his favorite team was playing in, but it was intense, watching him jump up and down and scream at the television. This was a sports fan in high dudgeon. And then came this moment: the score was tied, the seconds were ticking down, and his team had the ball. From maybe a quarter of the way down the field, without looking at where his teammates were, a forward kicked the ball into a mass of players in front of the goal. The problem was, none were on the kicker’s team. For an instant I felt deflated; then, suddenly, a player on my friend’s team appeared—at just the right place and time, and headed the ball into the goal. The player had ”“run full speed from midfield into the mass of opponents in front of the goal, where he seized the opportunity to head the ball. It was a total surprise. The forward who’d originally kicked the ball had faith, though, that his teammate would be where he was supposed to be. And that teammate had faith that the ball would be placed where he could do something with it. It was the kind of synchronicity that is inspiring to watch.

And that’s a place I want to help people reach with Scrum. It’s not impossible. It’s not only the elites and athletes and special people who can do this. It’s about setting up the right framework with the right incentives and giving people the freedom, respect, and authority to do things themselves. Greatness can’t be imposed; it has to come from within. But it does live within all of us.

# THE TAKEAWAY

* Pull the Right Lever. Change Team performance. That has much more impact—by several orders of magnitude—than individual performance.  
* Transcendence. Great teams have a purpose that is greater than the individual; e.g., burying General MacArthur, winning the NBA championship.  
* Autonomy. Give teams the freedom to make decisions on how to take action—to be respected as masters of their craft. The ability to improvise will make all the difference, whether the unit is reporting on a revolution in the Middle East or making a sale.  
* Cross-functional. The team must have every skill needed to complete a project, whether the mission is to deliver Salesforce.com software or capture terrorists in Iraq.  
* Small Wins. Small teams get work done faster than big teams. The rule of thumb is seven team members—plus or minus two. Err on the small side.  
* Blame Is Stupid. Don’t look for bad people; look for bad systems—ones that incentivize bad behavior and reward poor performance.
