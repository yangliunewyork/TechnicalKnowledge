Every company needs to think about this diagram. If you concentrate only on what you can build, you can end up making something that nobody actually wants, even if you’re passionate about it. If you concentrate only on what you can sell, you can promise things you can’t build. If you only build what you can sell but aren’t passionate about, you end up working hard to build mediocrity. But in the center, that sweet spot, is a vision rooted in reality—a vision with a real possibility of becoming something great. 

Scott Maxwell says that the true power of Scrum lies in its ready, prioritized, and sized Backlog of what to do. This is why he implemented it at the venture group, and why he thinks it is a critical competitive advantage.

### The Backlog: What to Do When

The first thing you need to do when you’re implementing Scrum is to create a Backlog. It can be hundreds of items long, or contain only the few things that you need to figure out first. Of course, you need a clear idea of what you want at the end of the work. It could be a product, a wedding, a service, a new vaccine, or a house painted. It could be anything, but once you have a vision, you need to consider what it will take to make that happen.

The list turned out to be hundreds of items long. It’s a big, complicated system. The idea behind the Backlog is that it should have everything that could possibly be included in the product. You’re never going to actually build it all, but you want a list of everything that could be included in that product vision.

The key, though, is what you decide to do first. The questions you need to ask are: what are the items that have the biggest business impact, that are most important to the customer, that can make the most money, and are the easiest to do? You have to realize that there are a whole bunch of things on that list that you will never get to, but you want to get to the things that deliver the most value with the lowest risk first. With Scrum’s incremental development and delivery, you want to begin with the things that will immediately create revenue, effectively “de-risking” the project. And you want to do that on the features level. You want to start delivering value to your customers as soon as you possibly can. You want something that is completely Done—that you can show. It could be just a small part of the larger project, but it should be demonstrably Done. If you’re painting a house, maybe what’s Done first is all the trim in the living room.

In product development there’s a hard-and-fast rule that has been proven over and over again. I talked about this earlier: 80 percent of the value is in 20 percent of the features. Think about that for a moment. In anything that you buy, most of the value—most of what people want—is in only a fifth of what has been built. In this company’s case they looked at this huge list of things that could be included in their home automation system, and they knew—they knew—that customers really only wanted 20 percent of them. The trick of Scrum is figuring out how you build that 20 percent first. In traditional product development, teams don’t know what that 20 percent is until they deliver the whole thing. That means that fully 80 percent of their effort is waste. And you know how I feel about waste.

What if you could start delivering things five times faster than your competition, with five times the value? That’s a winning hand.

So this automation company sat down with a huge list of features and asked themselves: “Okay, what do we do tomorrow? What’s most important to the customer? How do we deliver value to them faster than anyone else?” As Scott Maxwell says, the difficult part isn’t figuring out what you want to accomplish; it’s figuring out what you can accomplish. This is true whether you’re building a house or car, writing a book or videogame, or cleaning up crime or trash. Figure out where the most value can be delivered for the least effort, and do that one right away. Then identify the next increment of value, and the next. Faster than you think, you’ll have created something or delivered something with demonstrable, real results. The key is prioritizing the work.

How do you do that? Well, first you need someone who can figure out both what the vision is, and where the value lies. In Scrum we call that person the Product Owner.

### The Product Owner

__There are only three roles in Scrum. Either you’re part of the team, and you’re doing the work, or you’re a Scrum Master, helping the team figure out how to do the work better, or you’re a Product Owner. This is all laid out in the appendix. The Product Owner decides what the work should be. He or she owns the Backlog, what’s on it, and, most important, what order it’s in.__

> An individual’s responsibility for leadership is not dependent on authority.… the deep-rooted assumption that authority should equal responsibility is the root of much organizational evil. I believe misunderstanding around this issue is rampant, problematic, and runs so deep in our consciousness that we don’t even realize it.

The Chief Engineer can’t simply say something has to be done a particular way. He has to persuade, cajole, and demonstrate that his way is the right way, the best way. It usually takes someone with thirty years of experience to fill the role. I wanted that in Scrum, but I’m also well aware that very few people have that level of skill and experience. So I split the role in two, giving the Scrum Master the how and the Product Owner the what.

Even in those early days of Scrum I knew that I needed someone who was deeply connected to the customer. The Product Owner needed to be able to deliver feedback to the team from the customer each and every Sprint. They needed to spend half their time talking to the people buying the product (getting their thoughts on the latest incremental release and how it delivered value) and half their time with the team creating the Backlog (showing them what the customers valued and what they didn’t).

Remember, the “customer” could be the general consumer, a big bank, your husband, or someone who needs the rotavirus vaccine and is depending on you to get it to them. The customer is anyone who will get value from what you’re doing.

But I didn’t want a manager. I wanted someone the team would believe and trust when he prioritized the Backlog. So I went and got the smartest guy in Product Marketing—not in Engineering, mind you, but Marketing. And that’s how Don Rodner became the first Product Owner. He knew the product we were making not from a technical point of view—although he understood enough of that to communicate with the engineers—but, rather, from a customer point of view. What did the people who were actually using the product need? When you’re picking a Product Owner, get someone who can put themselves in the mind of whoever is getting value from what you’re doing. As a friend of mine says, “My wife is the perfect Product Owner; she knows exactly what she wants. I just implement it.”

Not only does the Product Owner need a wider range of skills than a Scrum Master, they need to be held to a different set of standards. The Scrum Master and the team are responsible for how fast they’re going and how much faster they can get. The Product Owner is accountable for translating the team’s productivity into value.

Over the years I’ve boiled down the essential characteristics of a Product Owner to four:

1. One, the Product Owner needs to be knowledgeable about the domain. By this I mean two things: the Product Owner should understand the process the team is executing well enough to know what can be done and, just as important, what can’t. But the Product Owner also has to understand the what well enough to know how to translate what can be done into true, meaningful value. It could be a computer system that helps the FBI catch terrorists, or a teaching method that improves student performance in public schools. The Product Owner needs to know the market well enough to know what will make a difference.  
2. Two, the Product Owner has to be empowered to make decisions. Just as management shouldn’t interfere with the team, the Product Owner should be given the leeway to make decisions about what the product vision will be, and what needs to be done to get there. This is important, because the Product Owner is under pressure from a lot of different stakeholders, both internal and external, and has to be able to hold firm. The Product Owner should be responsible for outcomes, but let the team make their own decisions.  
3. Three, the Product Owner has to be available to the team, to explain what needs to be done and why. While the Product Owner is ultimately accountable for the Backlog, there needs to be a constant dialogue with the team. Often the team’s expertise will inform the decisions the Product Owner needs to make. The Product Owner has to be reliable, consistent, and available. Without access to him, the team won’t know what to do, or what order to do it in. They rely on the Product Owner for “the vision” and, also, market intelligence on what is important. If the Product Owner isn’t available to the team, the whole process can fall apart. This is one of the reasons I rarely recommend that CEOs or other senior executives be Product Owners. They just don’t have the time the team needs.  
4. Four, the Product Owner needs to be accountable for value. In a business context what matters is revenue. I measure a Product Owner by how much revenue they deliver per “point” of effort. If the team is producing forty points of work every week, I want to measure how much revenue is created for each and every point. But the measurement of value could be how many successes a team has. I know one law enforcement team that measured value by the number of arrests of wanted felons they made each week. I know churches that use Scrum and measure their success by how well they’re serving their congregation, and whether it’s growing. The key is to decide what the measure of value is and hold the Product Owner accountable for delivering more of it. In Scrum this kind of metric is easy to observe because of the method’s incredible transparency.  

### Observe, Orient, Decide, Act

The idea goes by the somewhat ludicrous name of the OODA loop. That’s short for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. And while it may sound funny on the tongue, it’s deadly in war and in business. Getting inside someone’s loop reduces them to confusion and doubt. They overreact and underreact. As Boyd put it in a briefing he gave to other officers, “He who can handle the quickest rate of change survives.

“Observe” is fairly obvious—it’s clearly seeing the situation as it unfolds. This isn’t as simple as it sounds, though. Boyd described it as moving outside of yourself so as to see the whole picture—not merely your own point of view.

“Orient” is not just about where you are; it’s also about what outcomes you’re capable of seeing—the menu of alternatives you create for yourself. Factoring into that creation, according to Boyd, are genetic heritage, cultural traditions, previous experiences, and, of course, the unfolding circumstances. Thus, Orientation reflects not only how you see the world and your place in it, but what world you’re capable of seeing.

The combination of Observation and Orientation leads to a “Decision,” which leads to “Action.” Then the loop begins again with Observation of the results of your actions and those of your opponent—or, in the business world, Observation of the reaction of the marketplace.

What Scrum does, by delivering a working increment, is give the Product Owner the ability to see how much value that increment creates, how people react to it. Then, based on that information, she can change what the team will do in the next Sprint. This sets up a constant feedback cycle that accelerates innovation and adaptation, and enables the Product Owner to measure how much value is delivered. (In business we measure that by money. If I’m painting the interior of a house, I might measure it by rooms completed.) The Product Owner thus has the ability to adjust on the fly to a constantly changing world.

### First Things First

So you have a Product Owner who’s constantly updating the Backlog, ordering the stuff to be built and delivered. When you have a few hundred items, that ordering process can get pretty complex pretty fast. The key is to figure out how to deliver the most value the most quickly. There may be many millions of ways to arrange that Backlog, but the one you want delivers those 20 percent of features that hold 80 percent of the value as quickly as possible. Your first guess for the first Sprint almost certainly won’t be the right one, but it will be your best guess at the time.

But that’s just your first guess. After the first Sprint, once you’ve completed the OODA loop and delivered some product to customers, you’ll change that order, realizing that another arrangement is actually better.

And then you keep doing it, continually updating and re-prioritizing the Backlog each Sprint, tacking toward the order that delivers value the fastest. You’ll probably never reach the absolute perfect order, but you want to move toward it step by step, Sprint by Sprint.

The key thing to remember is that the order is always in flux. The right order one week won’t be the same the next. Your environment will have changed. You’ll have learned new things. You’ll have discovered that some things are easier and some harder. So this constant shifting of the Backlog order happens every single Sprint. The key is to acknowledge uncertainty, to fully accept that your current snapshot of order and value is only relevant at that one particular moment. It’ll change again. And again. And again.

### Release

So you have the priorities. You know where 80 percent of the value lies. When do you deliver your product? Here is where Scrum can deliver value radically faster. Whenever you’re making something, you want to put it in the hands of those who are actually going to use it as fast as possible. You want to do this even before you make 20 percent of the features. You want to do this with something that delivers at least a tiny bit of value. I call this a “Minimum Viable Product,” or MVP. This should be the thing you show to the public for the first time. How effective does it have to be? Well, it should actually work, though to a person who has been working on it, it may seem kind of embarrassing. You need to get that product out to the public as early as is feasible! This will get you the feedback you need to power your decision loop and prioritization. 

But what it gets you is feedback. The camera’s body is really awkward to hold because the shutter button is in a weird place. Make those mistakes early, with as little damage as possible.

This allows you to make the features they value, first, and release your product when you’ve only done about 20 percent of the work. You know it’s not perfect, but it’s darn close. Every hour spent polishing the apple is lost opportunity for value.

What’s great about this process is that it’s iterative: just “rinse and repeat.” Once people have your product or service or change in their lives, they’ll tell you what the next most valuable things are. Then develop 20 percent of that, and deliver again. And again.

With this incremental-release process, in the time it would’ve taken you to create half of the features of your initial product or project, you’ve now released 200 percent of the value, in half the time. That’s the real power of Scrum. That’s how it can fundamentally change not only how you work, but how you live your life. Don’t focus on delivering a whole list of things—everything and the kitchen sink—focus on delivering what’s valuable, what people actually want or need.

### Money for Nothing and Change for Free

Limit the number of changes, and you’ll limit the cost associated with them.

What the bean counters don’t realize is that they’re setting up a system that is designed to deny people what they actually want. They’re trying to limit cost, but in doing so, they’re limiting learning, innovation, and creativity. If you begin a project and realize a little way in that the real value, that 20 percent, doesn’t reside in the features you laid out—it lives in a different set of things you discovered in the process of doing the work—traditional project management is set up to stop you. It’s set up to stop delivering value faster.

Plus, the effort to “exercise firm control” doesn’t even work! Even with Change Control Boards trying to limit changes, the need for change is so great that they’re often overruled. Without the changes there wouldn’t be any value in the project. So, grudgingly, the Change Control Boards allow it, and the project costs more. And then there’s another change that has to be done. And, whoops, there’s another. And pretty soon the project is millions of dollars over budget, and a year, or two, or five years late.

That’s why I came up with the idea of “Change for Free.” In a standard fixed-price contract, just say changes are free. List all the functionality you expect; for example, if you’re building a tank, you want one that can go seventy-five miles per hour and shoot ten rounds a minute, has seating for four, has AC, etc., etc.—everything you think you need for that tank. The builder looks at that description and says, Hmm, making that engine, I’ll call that 100 points, the loading mechanism, let’s call that 50, the seating, 5, etc., on down the list. At the end there is a set number of points for each feature. Then every Sprint, the customer, who in this scenario is contractually obligated to work closely with the Product Owner, can change priorities completely. Any item or feature in the Backlog can be moved anywhere else. And new features? No problem: just drop equivalently sized features from the deliverables. Oh, you want a laser-guided system now? Well, that’s 50 points of work—to compensate for that addition, let’s drop 50 points of low-priority features from the bottom of the Backlog.

They could do this because of the building blocks of Scrum. By managing themselves as a cross-functional unit, the team was able to accelerate quickly, delivering more value faster. At the end of every Sprint an increment of the product was Done. It worked. It could be deployed immediately. Each Sprint the Product Owner was able to re-prioritize the Backlog based on customer feedback. And when there was enough value created for the customer, everyone stopped working. In this way Scrum aligns everyone’s interests: those of the team, the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, the customer, and the company. Everyone works toward the same goal and with the same vision: deliver real value as fast as possible.

### Risk

Management of risk is at the heart of any successful venture. What Scrum allows you to do is reduce the risks of failure. The three most common types are market risk, technical risk, and financial risk. Or, to put it another way: Do people want what we’re building? Can we actually build it? Can we really sell what we’ve built?

I’ve written a lot about market risk. Scrum helps you minimize it by emphasizing incremental delivery. It allows you to put a product in front of customers faster. And by obtaining feedback early and often, you can make small changes on the spot rather than be forced into big changes after you’ve invested millions of dollars and realize that what you’re building isn’t really what the customer actually wants. It’s often what the customer said they wanted at the beginning of the process, but in reality people don’t know what they really want until they can try something out. A lot of business advice revolves around failing quickly. I prefer to think about delivering fast.

Technical risk is interesting. The question of whether it’s actually possible to build what the customer wants is a tricky one, especially if you’re making something that is physical, which requires plants and tooling and up-front investment.

Remember the company with the home automation system? Well, they approached it by doing what is called “set-based concurrent engineering.” What that means in English is “building a few different prototypes to see which one works best before going into full production.”

Instead of making the decision up front and going full bore into manufacturing, they built three different fully functional lenses and compared them. Since they were only really trying to figure out the lens question, and they had to do it first because of long lead times in manufacturing, they tested each lens using a laptop-camera setup. Turned out, glass met the criteria the best. But, critically, they were able to make that judgment after seeing something that actually worked. The call wasn’t based on theoretical constructs. They had something they could look at and touch. With that question answered, they could move on to designing the case that would hold the lens and the processors that would handle the image. By prioritizing that lens decision, the company potentially saved themselves millions. Apple famously does this with all their products, often building a dozen fully functioning prototypes before organizing a shoot-out to see which one is the best. This allows different ideas to be expressed quickly without a massive investment.

What Scrum does for business is answer the key question fast: Will we make money making this? By putting incremental releases in front of customers quickly, you’ll find out what your customers value and what they’re willing to pay for. And if your first guesses were wrong, you can make changes. The most you can lose is the cost in time and energy of the few Sprints you invested—as opposed to the multimillion-dollar cost of building a huge complicated infrastructure, only to find out that, while people loved your product, they didn’t love it enough to pay for what it cost to make it.

### Here’s What You Do Tomorrow

Okay, what do you do tomorrow to implement Scrum where you work? The first step is just putting together a Backlog and a team. Think about the vision you have for your product or service or whatever, and start breaking down the things you need to do to execute that vision. You don’t need a whole lot—just a week’s worth of Backlog. And while the team members are holding their Daily Stand-up meetings and running their first Sprint, you’ll be able to build up enough Backlog to keep the team busy for the next two Sprints. Always keep one eye on that Backlog, though, because as your team accelerates, they’ll start delivering more than you thought possible.

Then, as the Product Owner, put together a road map of where you think things are going. What do you think you can get done this quarter? Where do you want to be this year? It’s important to remember that this is just a snapshot in time, so don’t overplan, just estimate. You’re not creating a binding contract of deliverables; you’re simply setting down your thoughts on where you’ll be in a while. Believe me, the picture will change. Perhaps radically.

The reason for doing this type of planning is to create transparency within the organization. If you have a sales team, they need to know what features you’re working on so they can start marketing them. Leadership needs to have some idea of where the revenue is going to come from—also, when and how much. The key message is that everything is being done in the open. Anyone can see where your product is at any time. They can see the stories move across the Scrum board to Done. They can graph story points against time on a Burndown Chart and watch a nice, steady line move toward zero, or burn down. They know how many story points your team did last Sprint, and how many you’re estimating they’ll do next. Know that as the Product Owner you’re going to be evaluated on revenue and cost.

What you’ll quickly find, especially if you’re working in a place with multiple teams, is that you’ll need to start putting together a Product Owner team so you can generate enough Backlog for the teams to plow through. You might have one Product Owner who focuses more on strategy and customer interaction, and another who’s more tactical, deciding what the teams will be working on during each Sprint.

The important thing, though, is just to begin. Just start. You can see the detailed steps on how to do it in the appendix. Scrum is designed so that you can boot up a team in a couple of days. Get your Backlog, plan your first Sprint, and away you go. You don’t need to devote a lot of time to planning, reflection, meditations, mission statements, or five-year projections. Leave all that to the competition, and let them eat your dust. 

### THE TAKEAWAY

* Make a List. Check It Twice. Create a list of everything that could possibly be done on a project. Then prioritize it. Put the items with the highest value and lowest risk at the top of that Backlog, then the next, and then the next.  
* The Product Owner. She translates vision into Backlog. She needs to understand the business case, the market, and the customer.  
* A Leader Isn’t a Boss. A Product Owner sets out what needs to be done and why. How the team accomplishes it and who accomplishes it is up to the team.  
* The Product Owner: Has knowledge of the domain and the power to make final decisions. He or she is available to answer questions and is accountable for delivering value.  
* Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA). See the whole strategic picture, but act tactically and quickly.  
* Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It’s better to give than to receive. Get inside your competition’s OODA loop and wrap them up in their own confusion.  
* Get Your Money for Nothing, and Your Change for Free. Create new things only as long as those new things deliver value. Be willing to swap them out for things that require equal effort. What in the beginning you thought you needed is never what is actually needed.
