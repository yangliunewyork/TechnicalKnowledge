Every company needs to think about this diagram. If you concentrate only on what you can build, you can end up making something that nobody actually wants, even if you’re passionate about it. If you concentrate only on what you can sell, you can promise things you can’t build. If you only build what you can sell but aren’t passionate about, you end up working hard to build mediocrity. But in the center, that sweet spot, is a vision rooted in reality—a vision with a real possibility of becoming something great. 

Scott Maxwell says that the true power of Scrum lies in its ready, prioritized, and sized Backlog of what to do. This is why he implemented it at the venture group, and why he thinks it is a critical competitive advantage.

### The Backlog: What to Do When

The first thing you need to do when you’re implementing Scrum is to create a Backlog. It can be hundreds of items long, or contain only the few things that you need to figure out first. Of course, you need a clear idea of what you want at the end of the work. It could be a product, a wedding, a service, a new vaccine, or a house painted. It could be anything, but once you have a vision, you need to consider what it will take to make that happen.

The list turned out to be hundreds of items long. It’s a big, complicated system. The idea behind the Backlog is that it should have everything that could possibly be included in the product. You’re never going to actually build it all, but you want a list of everything that could be included in that product vision.

The key, though, is what you decide to do first. The questions you need to ask are: what are the items that have the biggest business impact, that are most important to the customer, that can make the most money, and are the easiest to do? You have to realize that there are a whole bunch of things on that list that you will never get to, but you want to get to the things that deliver the most value with the lowest risk first. With Scrum’s incremental development and delivery, you want to begin with the things that will immediately create revenue, effectively “de-risking” the project. And you want to do that on the features level. You want to start delivering value to your customers as soon as you possibly can. You want something that is completely Done—that you can show. It could be just a small part of the larger project, but it should be demonstrably Done. If you’re painting a house, maybe what’s Done first is all the trim in the living room.

In product development there’s a hard-and-fast rule that has been proven over and over again. I talked about this earlier: 80 percent of the value is in 20 percent of the features. Think about that for a moment. In anything that you buy, most of the value—most of what people want—is in only a fifth of what has been built. In this company’s case they looked at this huge list of things that could be included in their home automation system, and they knew—they knew—that customers really only wanted 20 percent of them. The trick of Scrum is figuring out how you build that 20 percent first. In traditional product development, teams don’t know what that 20 percent is until they deliver the whole thing. That means that fully 80 percent of their effort is waste. And you know how I feel about waste.

What if you could start delivering things five times faster than your competition, with five times the value? That’s a winning hand.

So this automation company sat down with a huge list of features and asked themselves: “Okay, what do we do tomorrow? What’s most important to the customer? How do we deliver value to them faster than anyone else?” As Scott Maxwell says, the difficult part isn’t figuring out what you want to accomplish; it’s figuring out what you can accomplish. This is true whether you’re building a house or car, writing a book or videogame, or cleaning up crime or trash. Figure out where the most value can be delivered for the least effort, and do that one right away. Then identify the next increment of value, and the next. Faster than you think, you’ll have created something or delivered something with demonstrable, real results. The key is prioritizing the work.

How do you do that? Well, first you need someone who can figure out both what the vision is, and where the value lies. In Scrum we call that person the Product Owner.
