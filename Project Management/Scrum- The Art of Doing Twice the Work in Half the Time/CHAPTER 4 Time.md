Time is the ultimate limiter of human endeavor, affecting everything from how much we work, to how long things take, to how successful we are. The relentless one-way flow of time fundamentally shapes how we view the world and ourselves. As the seventeenth-century British poet Andrew Marvell famously put it, “Had we but world enough, and time” anything could be accomplished. But, of course, a sense of mortality hovers over our every effort. We know our time is limited. As such, isn’t it the greatest of crimes to waste it? 

### The Sprint

In the early 1990s the Media Lab was coming up with all sorts of neat stuff. This was during the time that the World Wide Web was being birthed, and they were doing everything from robots to the electronic ink that makes e-readers possible to new ways to encode sound. It was an incredibly heady time, and I tended to hire students coming out of the lab because they were chock-full of ideas, had an incredible ability to make things that were cool, and they could build them fast.

Their speed owed itself to a policy that the Media Lab had for all its projects. Every three weeks each team had to demonstrate to their colleagues what it was working on. This was an open demonstration; anyone could come. And if that demo wasn’t both working and cool, lab directors killed the project. This forced the students to build neat stuff fast and, most important, to get immediate feedback on it.

Think about many of the projects that you do. I’d bet that you seldom get feedback on them until completion—and that could be months, even years, away. You might be heading completely in the wrong direction for months and not suspect it. That’s throwing huge chunks of your life away. In business it could mean the difference between success and failure. I see this happen all the time: a company will spend years on a project that seemed like a good idea when the workers started on it, but by the time they cross the finish line, the market has fundamentally changed. The sooner you give things to your customers, the quicker they can tell you if you’re making something they need.
