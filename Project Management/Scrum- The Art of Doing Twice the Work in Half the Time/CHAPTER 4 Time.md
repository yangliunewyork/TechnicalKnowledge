Time is the ultimate limiter of human endeavor, affecting everything from how much we work, to how long things take, to how successful we are. The relentless one-way flow of time fundamentally shapes how we view the world and ourselves. As the seventeenth-century British poet Andrew Marvell famously put it, “Had we but world enough, and time” anything could be accomplished. But, of course, a sense of mortality hovers over our every effort. We know our time is limited. As such, isn’t it the greatest of crimes to waste it? 

### The Sprint

In the early 1990s the Media Lab was coming up with all sorts of neat stuff. This was during the time that the World Wide Web was being birthed, and they were doing everything from robots to the electronic ink that makes e-readers possible to new ways to encode sound. It was an incredibly heady time, and I tended to hire students coming out of the lab because they were chock-full of ideas, had an incredible ability to make things that were cool, and they could build them fast.

Their speed owed itself to a policy that the Media Lab had for all its projects. Every three weeks each team had to demonstrate to their colleagues what it was working on. This was an open demonstration; anyone could come. And if that demo wasn’t both working and cool, lab directors killed the project. This forced the students to build neat stuff fast and, most important, to get immediate feedback on it.

Think about many of the projects that you do. I’d bet that you seldom get feedback on them until completion—and that could be months, even years, away. You might be heading completely in the wrong direction for months and not suspect it. That’s throwing huge chunks of your life away. In business it could mean the difference between success and failure. I see this happen all the time: a company will spend years on a project that seemed like a good idea when the workers started on it, but by the time they cross the finish line, the market has fundamentally changed. The sooner you give things to your customers, the quicker they can tell you if you’re making something they need.

### Daily Stand-Up

There are two teams: one hardware and one software, each composed of about seven people. Every day each team gathers in front of a floor-to-ceiling whiteboard stretching from one end of the wall to the other. Just like at Team WIKISPEED there are a few columns drawn on the board: Backlog, Doing, Done. Listed in the columns are only the things that the team needs to get done in this Sprint. The tasks range from working with one of half a dozen specialty circuit-board vendors to mapping out how the accelerometer will talk to the rest of the ship. The Scrum Master, the person in charge of running the process, asks each team member three questions:

1. What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?  
2. What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint?  
3. What obstacles are getting in the team’s way?  

That’s it. That’s the whole meeting. If it takes more than fifteen minutes, you’re doing it wrong. What this does is help the whole team know exactly where everything is in the Sprint. Are all the tasks going to be completed on time? Are there opportunities to help other team members overcome obstacles? There’s no assigning of tasks from above—the team is autonomous; they do that. There’s no detailed reporting to management. Anyone in management or on another team can walk by and look at the avionics Scrum board and know exactly where everything stands.

What he did was map all the communication flows within the team—who was talking to whom, where information was flowing, and where it wasn’t. This type of mapping is a tool that can be used to spot bottlenecks or information hoarders. The greater the communication saturation—the more everyone knows everything—the faster the team. Basically, the metric spun off by this type of analysis measures how well everyone knows what they need to get their work done. 

So how could we get that kind of saturation on our team? The thing that cripples communication saturation is specialization—the number of roles and titles in a group. If people have a special title, they tend to do only things that seem a match for that title. And to protect the power of that role, they tend to hold on to specific knowledge.

So we got rid of all titles. I called everyone in and told them to rip up their business cards. If someone wanted to put a title on their resume, they could do it for external use only. In here, where the work was done, there were only team members.

The other ingredient in the Borland team’s “secret sauce” was that they would have everyone on the team meet every single day to discuss how they were performing. Getting everyone together in a room was key, because it gave the team the opportunity to self-organize around challenges. If someone was stuck with a problem—if the accelerometer wasn’t talking to the altimeter—everyone saw that the impediment could block the whole Sprint, and they swarmed on it, making sure it got fixed pronto.

And that’s how the daily meeting came to operate. We had certain rules. The meeting was held at the same time every day, and everyone had to be there. If the entire team wasn’t present, communication simply didn’t happen. And it didn’t matter what time of day the meeting took place, as long as it was at the same time every day. The point was to give the team a regular heartbeat.

The second rule was that the meeting couldn’t last more than fifteen minutes. We wanted it to be crisp, direct, and to the point. If something required further discussion, we noted it and met further after the daily meeting. The idea was to get the most actionable and valuable information in the least amount of time.

The third rule was that everyone had to actively participate. To help this happen, I said that everyone had to stand up. That way there’d be active talking and listening going on. It also would keep the meetings short.

This is the reason such a meeting is often called the Daily Stand-up or Daily Scrum. It doesn’t really matter what you call it. It has to be at the same time every day, with the same three questions, with everyone standing up, and last no more than fifteen minutes.

The problem that I frequently see crop up is that people have a tendency to treat the Daily Stand-up as simply individual reporting. “I did this … I’ll do that”—then on to the next person. The more optimum approach is closer to a football huddle. A wide receiver might say, “I’m having a problem with that defensive lineman,” to which an offensive blocker might respond, “I’ll take care of that. I’ll open that line.” Or the quarterback might say, “Our running game is hitting a wall; let’s surprise them with a pass to the left.” The idea is for the team to quickly confer on how to move toward victory—i.e., complete the Sprint. Passivity is not only lazy, it actively hurts the rest of the team’s performance. Once spotted, it needs to be eliminated immediately.

I want aggressive teams—ones that come out of the daily meeting knowing the most important thing they need to accomplish that day. One person will hear another say that a task will take a day, but another team member might know how to do it in an hour if they work together. I want teams emerging from that meeting saying things like, “Let’s nail this. Let’s do this.” The team needs to want to be great.

My standard speech to teams large and small is: “Do you really want to suck forever? Is that what your motivation is in life? Because it’s a choice, you know—you don’t have to be that way.” A team has to demand greatness from itself.

### Time and Time Again

What Scrum does is alter the very way you think about time. After engaging for a while in Sprints and Stand-ups, you stop seeing time as a linear arrow into the future but, rather, as something that is fundamentally cyclical. Each Sprint is an opportunity to do something totally new; each day, a chance to improve. Scrum encourages a holistic worldview. The person who commits to it will value each moment as a returning cycle of breath and life.

# THE TAKEAWAY

* Time Is Finite. Treat It That Way. Break down your work into what can be accomplished in a regular, set, short period—optimally one to four weeks. And if you’ve caught the Scrum fever, call it a Sprint.    
* Demo or Die. At the end of each Sprint, have something that’s done—something that can be used (to fly, drive, whatever).  
* Throw Away Your Business Cards. Titles are specialized status markers. Be known for what you do, not how you’re referred to.  
* Everyone Knows Everything. Communication saturation accelerates work.  
* One Meeting a Day. When it comes to team check-ins, once a day is enough. Get together for fifteen minutes at the Daily Stand-up, see what can be done to increase speed, and do it.
