### Introduction

A graph is nothing more than an abstract, mathematical representation of two or more entities, which are somehow connected or related to each other. Graphs model pairwise relations between objects. They are, therefore, always made up of the following components:

* The nodes of the graph, usually representing the objects mentioned previously: In math, we usually refer to these structures as vertices; but for this book, and in the context of graph databases such as Neo4j, we will always refer to vertices as nodes.  
* The links between the nodes of the graph: In math, we refer to these structures as edges, but again, for the purpose of this book, we will refer to these links as relationships.  
* The structure of how nodes and relationships are connected to each other makes a graph: Many important qualities, such as the number of edges connected to a node, what we referred to as degree, can be assessed. Many other such indicators also exist.
