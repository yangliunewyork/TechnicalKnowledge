# What is a binary tree ?

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 

In computing, binary trees are seldom used solely for their structure. Much more typical is to define a labeling function on the nodes, which associates some value to each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when there is only one child present matters in some of these applications, in particular it is significant in binary search trees.

### Full binary tree vs Complete binary tree

A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree or strictly binary tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

So you have no nodes with only 1 child. Appears to be the same as strict binary tree.

Here is an image of a full/strict binary tree, from google:

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

It seems to mean a balanced tree.
