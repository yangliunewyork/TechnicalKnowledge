### Packet transmission
In most applications of computer networks the requirement is for the transmission of logical units of information, or messages – sequences of data items of arbitrary length. But before a message is transmitted it is subdivided into packets. The simplest form of packet is a sequence of binary data (an array of bits or bytes) of restricted length, together with addressing information sufficient to identify the source and destination computers. Packets of restricted length are used:
* so that each computer in the network can allocate sufficient buffer storage to hold the largest possible incoming packet;
* to avoid the undue delays that would occur in waiting for communication channels to become free if long messages were transmitted without subdivision.

### Data streaming
The transmission and display of audio and video in real time is referred to as streaming. It requires much higher bandwidths than most other forms of communication in distributed systems.Multimedia applications rely upon the transmission of streams of audio and video data elements at guaranteed high rates and with bounded latencies. 

The timely delivery of audio and video streams depends upon the availability of connections with adequate quality of service – bandwidth, latency and reliability must all be considered. Ideally, adequate quality of service should be guaranteed. In general the Internet does not offer that capability, and the quality of real-time video streams sometimes reflects that, but in proprietary intranets such as those operated by media companies, guarantees are sometimes achieved. What is required is the ability to establish a channel from the source to the destination of a multimedia stream, with a predefined route through the network, a reserved set of resources at each node through which it will travel and buffering where appropriate to smooth any irregularities in the flow of data through the channel. Data can then be passed through the channel from sender to receiver at the required rate.

ATM networks are specifically designed to provide high bandwidth and low latencies and to support quality of service by the reservation of network resources. IPv6, the new network protocol for the Internet, includes features that enable each of the IP packets in a real-time stream to be identified and treated separately from other data at the network level.

Communication subsystems that provide quality of service guarantees require facilities for the preallocation of network resources and the enforcement of the allocations. The availability of effective implementations of these protocols in the general Internet will depend upon substantial changes to the transport and network layers.

### Switching schemes
A network consists of a set of nodes connected together by circuits. To transmit information between two arbitrary nodes, a switching system is required. Here we define the four types of switching that are used in computer networking.

* __Broadcast__ : Broadcasting is a transmission technique that involves no switching. Everything is transmitted to every node, and it is up to potential receivers to notice transmissions addressed to them. Some LAN technologies, including Ethernet, are based on broadcasting. Wireless networking is necessarily based on broadcasting, but in the absence of fixed circuits the broadcasts are arranged to reach nodes grouped in cells.
* __Circuit switching__ : At one time telephone networks were the only telecommunication networks. Their operation was simple to understand: when a caller dialled a number, the pair of wires from her phone to the local exchange was connected by an automatic switch at the exchange to the pair of wires connected to the other party’s phone. For a long-distance call the process was similar but the connection would be switched through a number of intervening exchanges to its destination. This system is sometimes referred to as the __plain old telephone system__, or POTS. It is a typical __circuit-switching network__.
* __Packet switching__ : The advent of computers and digital technology brought many new possibilities for telecommunication. At the most basic level, it brought processing and storage. These made it possible to construct a different kind of communication network called a store-and-forward network. Instead of making and breaking connections to build circuits, a store-and-forward network just forwards packets from their source to their destination. There is a computer at each switching node (that is, wherever several circuits need to be interconnected). Each packet arriving at a node is first stored in memory at the node and then processed by a program that transmits it on an outgoing circuit, which transfers the packet to another node that is closer to its ultimate destination.There is nothing really new in this idea: the postal system is a store-and-forward network for letters, with the processing done by humans or machinery at sorting offices. But in a computer network packets can be stored and processed fast enough to give an illusion of instantaneous transmission, even though the packet has to be routed through many nodes.
* __Frame relay__ : In reality, it takes anything from a few tens of microseconds to a few milliseconds to switch a packet through each network node in a store-and-forward network. This switching delay depends on the packet size, hardware speed and quantity of other traffic, but its lower bound is determined by the network bandwidth, since the entire packet must be received before it can be forwarded to another node. Much of the Internet is based on store-and-forward switching, and as we have already seen, even short Internet packets typically take up to 200 milliseconds to reach their destinations. Delays of this magnitude are too long for real-time applications such as telephony and video conferencing, where delays of less than 50 milliseconds are needed to sustain high-quality conversation. The frame relay switching method brings some of the advantages of circuit switching to packet-switching networks. They overcome the delay problems by switching small packets (called frames) on the fly. The switching nodes (which are usually special-purpose parallel digital processors) route frames based on the examination of their first few bits; frames as a whole are not stored at nodes but pass through them as short streams of bits. ATM networks are a prime example; high-speed ATM networks can transmit packets across networks consisting of many nodes in a few tens of microseconds.

### Protocols
The term protocol is used to refer to a well-known set of rules and formats to be used for communication between processes in order to perform a given task. The definition of a protocol has two important parts to it:
* a specification of the sequence of messages that must be exchanged;
* a specification of the format of the data in the messages.

The existence of well-known protocols enables the separate software components of distributed systems to be developed independently and implemented in different programming languages on computers that may have different order codes and data representations.

A protocol is implemented by a pair of software modules located in the sending and receiving computers. For example, a __transport protocol__ transmits messages of any length from a sending process to a receiving process. A process wishing to transmit a message to another process issues a call to a transport protocol module, passing it a message in the specified format. The transport software then concerns itself with the transmission of the message to its destination, subdividing it into packets of some specified size and format that can be transmitted to the destination via the __network protocol__ – another, lower-level protocol. The corresponding transport protocol module in the receiving computer receives the packet via the network-level protocol module and performs inverse transformations to regenerate the message before passing it to a receiving process.

* __Protocol layers__ : Network software is arranged in a hierarchy of layers. Each layer presents an interface to the layers above it that extends the properties of the underlying communication system. A layer is represented by a module in every computer connected to the network. Each module appears to communicate directly with a module at the same level in another computer in the network, but in reality data is not transmitted directly between the protocol modules at each level. Instead, each layer of network software communicates by __local procedure calls__ with the layers above and below it.
On the sending side, each layer (except the topmost, or application layer) accepts items of data in a specified format from the layer above it and applies transformations to encapsulate the data in the format specified for that layer before passing it to the layer below for further processing.he figure shows the packet headers that hold most network-related data items, but for clarity it omits the trailers that are present in some types of packet; it also assumes that the application-layer message to be transmitted is shorter than the underlying network’s maximum packet size. If not, it would have to be encapsulated in several network-layer packets. On the receiving side, the converse transformations are applied to data items received from the layer below before they are passed to the layer above. The protocol type of the layer above is included in the header of each layer, to enable the protocol stack at the receiver to select the correct software components to unpack the packets. Thus each layer provides a service to the layer above it and extends the service provided by the layer below it. At the bottom is a __physical layer__. This is implemented by a communication medium (copper or fibre optic cables, satellite communication channels or radio transmission) and by analogue signalling circuits that place signals on the communication medium at the sending node and sense them at the receiving node. At receiving nodes data items are received and passed upwards through the hierarchy of software modules, being transformed at each stage until they are in a form that can be passed to the intended recipient process.
* __Protocol suites__ : A complete set of protocol layers is referred to as a protocol suite or a protocol stack, reflecting the layered structure. The OSI Reference Model was adopted in order to encourage the development of protocol standards that would meet the requirements of open systems. Protocol layering brings substantial benefits in simplifying and generalizing the software interfaces for access to the communication services of networks, but it also carries significant performance costs. The transmission of an application-level message via a protocol stack with N layers typically involves N transfers of control to the relevant layer of software in the protocol suite, at least one of which is an operating system entry, and taking N copies of the data as a part of the encapsulation mechanism. All of these overheads result in data transfer rates between application processes that are much lower than the available network bandwidth.  But the implementation of the Internet does not follow the OSI model in two respects. First, the application, presentation and session layers are not clearly distinguished in the Internet protocol stack. Instead, the application and presentation layers are implemented either as a single middleware layer or separately within each application. Thus CORBA implements inter-object invocations and data representations in a middleware library that is included in each application process. Web browsers and other applications that require secure channels employ the Secure Sockets Layer (Chapter 11) as a procedure library in a similar manner. Second, the session layer is integrated with the transport layer. Internetwork protocol suites include an application layer, a transport layer and an __internetwork layer__. The internetwork layer is a ‘virtual’ network layer that is responsible for transmitting internetwork packets to a destination computer. An __internetwork packet__ is the unit of data transmitted over an internetwork.

* __Packet assembly__ : The task of dividing messages into packets before transmission and reassembling them at the receiving computer is usually performed in the transport layer. The network-layer protocol packets consist of a header and a data field. 
* __Ports__  : The transport layer’s task is to provide a network-independent message transport service between pairs of network ports. Ports are software-defined destination points at a host computer. They are attached to processes, enabling data transmission to be addressed to a specific process at a destination node. 
* __Addressing__ : The transport layer is responsible for delivering messages to destinations with transport addresses that are composed of the network address of a host computer and a port number. A network address is a numeric identifier that uniquely identifies a host computer and enables it to be located by nodes that are responsible for routing data to it. In the Internet every host computer is assigned an IP number, which identifies it and the subnet to which it is connected, enabling data to be routed to it from any other node. In Ethernets there are no routing nodes; each host is responsible for recognizing and picking up packets addressed to it. Well-known Internet services such as HTTP and FTP have been allocated contact port numbers and these are registered with a central authority (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [www.iana.org I]). To access a service at a given host, a request is sent to the relevant port at the host. Some services, such as FTP (contact port: 21), then allocate a new port (with a private number) and send the number of the new port to the client. The client uses the new port for the remainder of a transaction or a session. Other services, such as HTTP (contact port: 80), transact all of their business through the contact port. 

Port numbers below 1023 are defined as well-known ports whose use is restricted to privileged processes in most operating systems. The ports between 1024 and 49151 are registered ports for which IANA holds service descriptions, and the remaining ports up to 65535 are available for private purposes. In practice, all of the ports above 1023 can be used for private purposes, but computers using them for private purposes cannot simultaneously access the corresponding registered services.

A fixed port number allocation does not provide an adequate basis for the development of distributed systems which often include a multiplicity of servers including dynamically allocated ones. Solutions to this problem involve the dynamic allocation of ports to services and the provision of binding mechanisms to enable clients to locate services and their ports using symbolic names. 

* __Packet delivery__ : There are two approaches to the delivery of packets by the network layer: Datagram packet delivery: The term ‘datagram’ refers to the similarity of this delivery mode to the way in which letters and telegrams are delivered. The essential feature of datagram networks is that the delivery of each packet is a ‘one-shot’ process; no setup is required, and once the packet is delivered the network retains no information about it. In a datagram network a sequence of packets transmitted by a single host to a single destination may follow different routes (if, for example, the network is capable of adaptation to handle failures or to mitigate the effects of localized congestion), and when this occurs they may arrive out of sequence. Every datagram packet contains the full network address of the source and destination hosts; the latter is an essential parameter for the routing process. Datagram delivery is the concept on which packet networks were originally based, and it can be found in most of the computer networks in use today. The Internet’s network layer (IP), Ethernet and most wired and wireless local network technologies are based on datagram delivery.

> Virtual circuit packet delivery: Some network-level services implement packet transmission in a manner that is analogous to a telephone network. A virtual circuit must be set up before packets can pass from a source host A to destination host B. The establishment of a virtual circuit involves the identification of a route from the source to the destination, possibly passing through several intermediate nodes. At each node along the route a table entry is made, indicating which link should be used for the next stage of the route.
> Once a virtual circuit has been set up, it can be used to transmit any number of packets. Each network-layer packet contains only a virtual circuit number in place of the source and destination addresses. The addresses are not needed, because packets are routed at intermediate nodes by reference to the virtual circuit number. When a packet reaches its destination the source can be determined from the virtual circuit number.  
> The analogy with telephone networks should not be taken too literally. In the POTS a telephone call results in the establishment of a physical circuit from the caller to the callee, and the voice links from which it is constructed are reserved for their exclusive use. In virtual circuit packet delivery the circuits are represented only by table entries in routing nodes, and the links along which the packets are routed are used only for the time taken to transmit a packet; they are free for other uses for the rest of the time. A single link may therefore be employed in many separate virtual circuits. The most important virtual circuit network technology in current use is ATM; we have already mentioned that it benefits from lower latencies for the transmission of individual packets; this is a direct result of its use of virtual circuits. The requirement for a setup phase does, however, result in a short delay before any packets can be sent to a new destination.

The distinction between datagram and virtual circuit packet delivery in the network layer should not be confused with a similarly named pair of mechanisms in the transport layer: connectionless and connection-oriented transmission.

### Routing
Routing is a function that is required in all networks except those LANs, such as Ethernets, that provide direct connections between all pairs of attached hosts. In large networks, adaptive routing is employed: the best route for communication between two points in the network is re-evaluated periodically, taking into account the current traffic in the network and any faults such as broken connections or routers.

The delivery of packets to their destinations in a network is the collective responsibility of the routers located at connection points. Unless the source and destination hosts are on the same LAN, the packet has to be transmitted in a series of hops, passing through router nodes. The determination of routes for the transmission of packets to their destinations is the responsibility of a routing algorithm implemented by a program in the network layer at each node.
A routing algorithm has two parts:

1. It must make decisions that determine the route taken by each packet as it travels through the network. In circuit-switched network layers such as X.25 and frame- relay networks such as ATM, the route is determined whenever a virtual circuit or connection is established. In packet-switched network layers such as IP it is determined separately for each packet, and the algorithm must be particularly simple and efficient if it is not to degrade network performance.
2. It must dynamically update its knowledge of the network based on traffic monitoring and the detection of configuration changes or failures. This activity is less time-critical; slower and more computation-intensive techniques can be used.

Both of these activities are distributed throughout the network. The routing decisions are made on a hop-by-hop basis, using locally held information to determine the next hop to be taken by each incoming packet. The locally held routing information is updated periodically by an algorithm that distributes information about the states of the links (their loads and failure status).

### Congestion control
The capacity of a network is limited by the performance of its communication links and switching nodes. When the load at any particular link or node approaches its capacity, queues will build up at hosts trying to send packets and at intermediate nodes holding packets whose onward transmission is blocked by other traffic. If the load continues at the same high level, the queues will continue to grow until they reach the limit of available buffer space.

Once this state is reached at a node, the node has no option but to drop further incoming packets. As we have already noted, the occasional loss of packets at the network level is acceptable and can be remedied by retransmission initiated at higher levels. But if the rate of packet loss and retransmission reaches a substantial level, the effect on the throughput of the network can be devastating. It is easy to see why this is the case: if packets are dropped at intermediate nodes, the network resources that they have already consumed are wasted and the resulting retransmissions will require a similar quantity of resources to reach the same point in the network. As a rule of thumb, when the load on a network exceeds 80% of its capacity, the total throughput tends to drop as a result of packet losses unless usage of heavily loaded links is controlled.

Instead of allowing packets to travel through the network until they reach over-congested nodes, where they will have to be dropped, it would be better to hold them at earlier nodes until the congestion is reduced. This will result in increased delays for packets but will not significantly degrade the total throughput of the network. __Congestion control__ is the name given to techniques that are designed to achieve this.

In general, congestion control is achieved by informing nodes along a route that congestion has occurred and that their rate of packet transmission should therefore be reduced. For intermediate nodes, this will result in the buffering of incoming packets for a longer period. For hosts that are sources of the packets, the result may be to queue packets before transmission or to block the application process that is generating them until the network can handle them.

All datagram-based network layers, including IP and Ethernets, rely on the end- to-end control of traffic. That is, the sending node must reduce the rate at which it transmits packets based only on information that it receives from the receiver. Congestion information may be supplied to the sending node by explicit transmission of special messages (called choke packets) requesting a reduction in transmission rate, by the implementation of a specific transmission control protocol or by observing the occurrence of dropped packets (if the protocol is one in which each packet is acknowledged).

In some virtual circuit based networks, congestion information can be received and acted on at each node. Although ATM uses virtual circuit delivery, it relies on quality of service management to ensure that each circuit can carry the required traffic.

### Internetworking
There are many network technologies with different network-, link- and physical-layer protocols. Local networks are built with Ethernet technologies, while wide area networks are built over analogue and digital telephone networks of various types, satellite links and wide area ATM networks. Individual computers and local networks are linked to the Internet or intranets by modems and by wireless and DSL connections.

To build an integrated network (an internetwork) we must integrate many subnets, each of which is based on one of these network technologies. To make this possible, the following are needed:

1. a unified internetwork addressing scheme that enables packets to be addressed to any host connected to any subnet;
2. a protocol defining the format of internetwork packets and giving rules according to which they are handled;
3. interconnecting components that route packets to their destinations in terms of internetwork addresses, transmitting the packets using subnets with a variety of network technologies.

For the Internet, (1) is provided by IP addresses, (2) is the IP protocol and (3) is performed by components called Internet routers.

* __Routers__ : We have noted that routing is required in all networks except those such as Ethernets and wireless networks, in which all of the hosts are connected by a single transmission medium. 
* __Bridges__ : Bridges link networks of different types. Some bridges link several networks, and these are referred to as bridge/routers because they also perform routing functions. 
* __Hubs__ : Hubs are simply a convenient means of connecting hosts and extending segments of Ethernet and other broadcast local network technologies. They have a number of sockets (typically 4–64), to each of which a host computer can be connected. They can also be used to overcome the distance limitations on single segments and provide a means of adding additional hosts.
* __Switches__ : Switches perform a similar function to routers, but for local networks (normally Ethernets) only. That is, they interconnect several separate Ethernets, routing the incoming packets to the appropriate outgoing network. They perform their task at the level of the Ethernet network protocol. When they start up they have no knowledge of the wider internetwork and build up routing tables by the observation of traffic, supplemented by broadcast requests when they lack information. The advantage of switches over hubs is that they separate the incoming traffic and transmit it only on the relevant outgoing network, reducing congestion on the other networks to which they are connected.
* __Tunnelling__ : Bridges and routers transmit internetwork packets over a variety of underlying networks by translating between their network-layer protocols and an internetwork protocol, but there is one situation in which the underlying network protocol can be hidden from the layers above it without the use of an internetwork protocol. A pair of nodes connected to separate networks of the same type can communicate through another type of network by constructing a protocol ‘tunnel’. A protocol tunnel is a software layer that transmits packets through an alien network environment.
