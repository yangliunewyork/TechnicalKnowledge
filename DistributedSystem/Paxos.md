# What is Paxos

Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. Consensus is the process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants. This problem becomes difficult when the participants or their communication medium may experience failures.

Consensus protocols are the basis for the __state machine replication__ approach to distributed computing, as suggested by Leslie Lamport and surveyed by Fred B. Schneider. State machine replication is a technique for converting an algorithm into a fault-tolerant, distributed implementation. Ad-hoc techniques may leave important cases of failures unresolved. The principled approach proposed by Lamport et al. ensures all cases are handled safely.

The Paxos family of protocols includes a spectrum of trade-offs between the number of processors, number of message delays before learning the agreed value, the activity level of individual participants, number of messages sent, and types of failures. Although no deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol can guarantee progress in an asynchronous network (a result proven in a paper by Fischer, Lynch and Paterson), Paxos guarantees safety (consistency), and the conditions that could prevent it from making progress are difficult to provoke.

Paxos is usually used where durability is required (for example, to replicate a file or a database), in which the amount of durable state could be large. The protocol attempts to make progress even during periods when some bounded number of replicas are unresponsive. There is also a mechanism to drop a permanently failed replica or to add a new replica.

# Assumptions

In order to simplify the presentation of Paxos, the following assumptions and definitions are made explicit. Techniques to broaden the applicability are known in the literature, and are not covered in this article.

#### Processors

* Processors operate at arbitrary speed.
* Processors may experience failures.
* Processors with stable storage may re-join the protocol after failures (following a crash-recovery failure model).  
* Processors do not collude, lie, or otherwise attempt to subvert the protocol. 

#### Network

* Processors can send messages to any other processor.  
* Messages are sent asynchronously and may take arbitrarily long time to deliver.  
* Messages may be lost, reordered, or duplicated.  
* Messages are delivered without corruption.  

# Roles

Paxos describes the actions of the processes by their roles in the protocol: client, acceptor, proposer, learner, and leader. In typical implementations, a single processor may play one or more roles at the same time. This does not affect the correctness of the protocolâ€”it is usual to coalesce roles to improve the latency and/or number of messages in the protocol.

* Client : The Client issues a request to the distributed system, and waits for a response. For instance, a write request on a file in a distributed file server.  
* Acceptor (Voters) : The Acceptors act as the fault-tolerant "memory" of the protocol. Acceptors can form Quorums (cf. the definition of Quorum below). Any message sent to an Acceptor must be sent to a Quorum of Acceptors. Any message received from an Acceptor is ignored unless a copy is received from each Acceptor in a Quorum.
* Proposer : A Proposer advocates a client request, attempting to convince the Acceptors to agree on it, and acting as a coordinator to move the protocol forward when conflicts occur.
* Learner : Learners act as the replication factor for the protocol. Once a Client request has been agreed on by the Acceptors, the Learner may take action (i.e.: execute the request and send a response to the client). To improve availability of processing, additional Learners can be added.
* Leader : Paxos requires a distinguished Proposer (called the leader) to make progress. Many processes may believe they are leaders, but the protocol only guarantees progress if one of them is eventually chosen. If two processes believe they are leaders, they may stall the protocol by continuously proposing conflicting updates. However, the safety properties are still preserved in that case.

### Quorums
Quorums express the safety properties of Paxos by ensuring at least some surviving processor retains knowledge of the results.
Quorums are defined as subsets of the set of Acceptors such that any two subsets (that is, any two Quorums) share at least one member. Typically, a Quorum is any majority of participating Acceptors. For example, given the set of Acceptors {A,B,C,D}, a majority Quorum would be any three Acceptors: {A,B,C}, {A,C,D}, {A,B,D}, {B,C,D}. More generally, arbitrary positive weights can be assigned to Acceptors and a Quorum defined as any subset of Acceptors with the summary weight greater than half of the total weight of all Acceptors.

##### Proposal Number & Agreed Value

Each attempt to define an agreed value v is performed with proposals which may or may not be accepted by Acceptors. Each proposal is uniquely numbered for a given Proposer. The value corresponding to a numbered proposal can be computed as part of running the Paxos protocol, but need not be.
