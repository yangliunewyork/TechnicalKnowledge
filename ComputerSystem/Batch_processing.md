__Batch processing__ is the execution of a series of jobs in a program on a computer without manual intervention (non-interactive). Strictly speaking, it is a __processing mode__: the execution of a series of programs each on a set or "batch" of inputs, rather than a single input (which would instead be a custom job). However, this distinction has largely been lost, and the series of steps in a batch process are often called a "job" or "batch job".

# Benefits

Batch processing has these benefits:

* It can shift the time of job processing to when the computing resources are less busy.  
* It avoids idling the computing resources with minute-by-minute manual intervention and supervision.  
* By keeping high overall rate of utilization, it amortizes the computer, especially an expensive one.  
* It allows the system to use different priorities for interactive and non-interactive work.  
* Rather than running one program multiple times to process one transaction each time, batch processes will run the program only once for many transactions, reducing system overhead.  

It also has multiple disadvantages, for instance users are unable to terminate a process during execution, and have to wait until execution completes.
