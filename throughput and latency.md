## Difference, example of throughput and latency

* Latency is the time required to perform some action or to produce some result. Latency is measured in units of time -- hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds or clock periods.
* Throughput is the number of such actions executed or results produced per unit of time. This is measured in units of whatever is being produced (cars, motorcycles, I/O samples, memory words, iterations) per unit of time.
Many systems can be characterized as dominated either by throughput limitations or by latency limitations in terms of end-user utility or experience.Latency and throughput are not necessarily correlated, because of data density. A system that has high latency but can transfer a huge amount of data can still have higher throughput than a low-latency system.

Example:
An assembly line is manufacturing cars. It takes eight hours to manufacture a car and that the factory produces one hundred and twenty cars per day.
The latency is: 8 hours.
The throughput is: 120 cars / day or 5 cars / hour.
