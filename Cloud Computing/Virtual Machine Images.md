A virtual machine image is a template for creating new instances. You can choose images from a catalog to create images or save your own images from running instances. Specialists in those platforms often create catalog images, making sure that they are created with the proper patches and that any software is installed and configured with good default settings. The images can be plain operating systems or can have software installed on them, such as databases, application servers, or other applications. Images usually remove some data related to runtime operations, such as swap data and configuration files with embedded IP addresses or host names.
