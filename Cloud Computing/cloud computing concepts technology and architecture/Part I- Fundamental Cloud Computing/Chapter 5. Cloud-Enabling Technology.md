## 5.1. Broadband Networks and Internet Architecture

All clouds must be connected to a network. This inevitable requirement forms an inherent dependency on internetworking.

Internetworks, or the Internet, allow for the remote provisioning of IT resources and are directly supportive of ubiquitous network access. Cloud consumers have the option of accessing the cloud using only private and dedicated network links in LANs, although most clouds are Internet-enabled. The potential of cloud platforms therefore generally grows in parallel with advancements in Internet connectivity and service quality.

### Summary of Key Points

* Cloud consumers and cloud providers typically use the Internet to communicate, which is based on a decentralized provisioning and management model and is not controlled by any centralized entities.
* The main components of internetworking architecture are connectionless packet switching and router-based interconnectivity, which use network routers and switches. Network bandwidth and latency are characteristics that influence QoS, which is heavily impacted by network congestion.
