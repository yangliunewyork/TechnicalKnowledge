## 6.1. Basic Terms and Concepts

##### Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the characteristic of something being made accessible only to authorized parties. Within cloud environments, confidentiality primarily pertains to restricting access to data in transit and storage.

##### Integrity

Integrity is the characteristic of not having been altered by an unauthorized party. An important issue that concerns data integrity in the cloud is whether a cloud consumer can be guaranteed that the data it transmits to a cloud service matches the data received by that cloud service. Integrity can extend to how data is stored, processed, and retrieved by cloud services and cloud-based IT resources.

##### Authenticity

Authenticity is the characteristic of something having been provided by an authorized source. This concept encompasses non-repudiation, which is the inability of a party to deny or challenge the authentication of an interaction. Authentication in non-repudiable interactions provides proof that these interactions are uniquely linked to an authorized source. For example, a user may not be able to access a non-repudiable file after its receipt without also generating a record of this access.

##### Availability

Availability is the characteristic of being accessible and usable during a specified time period. In typical cloud environments, the availability of cloud services can be a responsibility that is shared by the cloud provider and the cloud carrier. The availability of a cloud-based solution that extends to cloud service consumers is further shared by the cloud consumer.

##### Threat

A threat is a potential security violation that can challenge defenses in an attempt to breach privacy and/or cause harm. Both manually and automatically instigated threats are designed to exploit known weaknesses, also referred to as vulnerabilities. A threat that is carried out results in an attack.

##### Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited either because it is protected by insufficient security controls, or because existing security controls are overcome by an attack. IT resource vulnerabilities can have a range of causes, including configuration deficiencies, security policy weaknesses, user errors, hardware or firmware flaws, software bugs, and poor security architecture.

##### Risk

Risk is the possibility of loss or harm arising from performing an activity. Risk is typically measured according to its threat level and the number of possible or known vulnerabilities. Two metrics that can be used to determine risk for an IT resource are:

* the probability of a threat occurring to exploit vulnerabilities in the IT resource
* the expectation of loss upon the IT resource being compromised

##### Security Controls

Security controls are countermeasures used to prevent or respond to security threats and to reduce or avoid risk. Details on how to use security countermeasures are typically outlined in the security policy, which contains a set of rules and practices specifying how to implement a system, service, or security plan for maximum protection of sensitive and critical IT resources.

### Summary of Key Points

* Confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability are characteristics that can be associated with measuring security.
* Threats, vulnerabilities, and risks are associated with measuring and assessing insecurity, or the lack of security.
* Security controls, mechanisms, and policies are associated with establishing countermeasures and safeguards in support of improving security.

## 6.2. Threat Agents

### Summary of Key Points

* An anonymous attacker is a non-trusted threat agent that usually attempts attacks from outside of a cloudâ€™s boundary.
* A malicious service agent intercepts network communication in an attempt to maliciously use or augment the data.
* A trusted attacker exists as an authorized cloud service consumer with legitimate credentials that it uses to exploit access to cloud-based IT resources.
* A malicious insider is a human that attempts to abuse access privileges to cloud premises.

## 6.3. Cloud Security Threats

### Summary of Key Points

* Traffic eavesdropping and malicious intermediary attacks are usually carried out by malicious service agents that intercept network traffic.  
* A denial of service attack occurs when a targeted IT resource is overloaded with requests in an attempt to cripple or render it unavailable. The insufficient authorization attack occurs when access is granted to an attacker erroneously or too broadly, or when weak passwords are used.  
* A virtualization attack exploits vulnerabilities within virtualized environments to gain unauthorized access to underlying physical hardware. Overlapping trust boundaries represent a threat whereby attackers can exploit cloud-based IT resources shared by multiple cloud consumers.  

## 6.4. Additional Considerations

### Summary of Key Points

* Cloud consumers need to be aware that they may be introducing security risks by deploying flawed cloud-based solutions.
* An understanding of how a cloud provider defines and imposes proprietary, and possibly incompatible, cloud security policies is a critical part of forming assessment criteria when choosing a cloud provider vendor.
* Liability, indemnity, and blame for potential security breaches need to be clearly defined and mutually understood in the legal agreements signed by cloud consumers and cloud providers.
* It is important for cloud consumers, subsequent to gaining an understanding of the potential security-related issues specific to a given cloud environment, to perform a corresponding assessment of the identified risks.
