## 4.1. Roles and Boundaries

#### Cloud Provider

The organization that provides cloud-based IT resources is the cloud provider. When assuming the role of cloud provider, an organization is responsible for making cloud services available to cloud consumers, as per agreed upon SLA guarantees. The cloud provider is further tasked with any required management and administrative duties to ensure the on-going operation of the overall cloud infrastructure.

#### Cloud Consumer

A cloud consumer is an organization (or a human) that has a formal contract or arrangement with a cloud provider to use IT resources made available by the cloud provider. Specifically, the cloud consumer uses a cloud service consumer to access a cloud service.

#### Cloud Service Owner

The person or organization that legally owns a cloud service is called a cloud service owner. The cloud service owner can be the cloud consumer, or the cloud provider that owns the cloud within which the cloud service resides.

#### Cloud Resource Administrator

A cloud resource administrator is the person or organization responsible for administering a cloud-based IT resource (including cloud services). The cloud resource administrator can be (or belong to) the cloud consumer or cloud provider of the cloud within which the cloud service resides. Alternatively, it can be (or belong to) a third-party organization contracted to administer the cloud-based IT resource.

### Summary of Key Points

* Common roles associated with cloud-based interaction and relationships include the cloud provider, cloud consumer, cloud service owner, and cloud resource administrator.  
* An organizational boundary represents the physical scope of IT resources owned and governed by an organization. A trust boundary is the logical perimeter that encompasses the IT resources trusted by an organization.  

## 4.2. Cloud Characteristics

An IT environment requires a specific set of characteristics to enable the remote provisioning of scalable and measured IT resources in an effective manner. These characteristics need to exist to a meaningful extent for the IT environment to be considered an effective cloud.

The following six specific characteristics are common to the majority of cloud environments:

* on-demand usage
* ubiquitous access
* multitenancy (and resource pooling)
* elasticity
* measured usage
* resiliency 

Cloud providers and cloud consumers can assess these characteristics individually and collectively to measure the value offering of a given cloud platform. Although cloud-based services and IT resources will inherit and exhibit individual characteristics to varying extents, usually the greater the degree to which they are supported and utilized, the greater the resulting value proposition.
