## 10.1. Encryption

Data, by default, is coded in a readable format known as plaintext. When transmitted over a network, plaintext is vulnerable to unauthorized and potentially malicious access. The encryption mechanism is a digital coding system dedicated to preserving the confidentiality and integrity of data. It is used for encoding plaintext data into a protected and unreadable format.

Encryption technology commonly relies on a standardized algorithm called a cipher to transform original plaintext data into encrypted data, referred to as ciphertext. Access to ciphertext does not divulge the original plaintext data, apart from some forms of metadata, such as message length and creation date. When encryption is applied to plaintext data, the data is paired with a string of characters called an encryption key, a secret message that is established by and shared among authorized parties. The encryption key is used to decrypt the ciphertext back into its original plaintext format.

The encryption mechanism can help counter the traffic eavesdropping, malicious intermediary, insufficient authorization, and overlapping trust boundaries security threats. For example, malicious service agents that attempt traffic eavesdropping are unable to decrypt messages in transit if they do not have the encryption key.

There are two common forms of encryption known as __symmetric encryption__ and __asymmetric encryption__.‚Äù

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, both of which are performed by authorized parties that use the one shared key. Also known as secret key cryptography, messages that are encrypted with a specific key can be decrypted by only that same key. Parties that rightfully decrypt the data are provided with evidence that the original encryption was performed by parties that rightfully possess the key. A basic authentication check is always performed, because only authorized parties that own the key can create messages. This maintains and verifies data confidentiality.
Note that symmetrical encryption does not have the characteristic of non-repudiation, since determining exactly which party performed the message encryption or decryption is not possible if more than one party is in possession of the key.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption relies on the use of two different keys, namely a private key and a public key. With asymmetric encryption (which is also referred to as public key cryptography), the private key is known only to its owner while the public key is commonly available. A document that was encrypted with a private key can only be correctly decrypted with the corresponding public key. Conversely, a document that was encrypted with a public key can be decrypted only using its private key counterpart. As a result of two different keys being used instead of just the one, asymmetric encryption is almost always computationally slower than symmetric encryption.

The level of security that is achieved is dictated by whether a private key or public key was used to encrypt the plaintext data. As every asymmetrically encrypted message has its own private-public key pair, messages that were encrypted with a private key can be correctly decrypted by any party with the corresponding public key. This method of encryption does not offer any confidentiality protection, even though successful decryption proves that the text was encrypted by the rightful public key owner. Private key encryption therefore offers integrity protection in addition to authenticity and non-repudiation. A message that was encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the rightful private key owner, which provides confidentiality protection. However, any party that has the public key can generate the ciphertext, meaning this method provides neither message integrity nor authenticity protection due to the communal nature of the public key.

#### Note

The encryption mechanism, when used to secure Web-based data transmissions, is most commonly applied via HTTPS, which refers to the use of SSL/TLS as an underlying encryption protocol for HTTP. TLS (transport layer security) is the successor to the SSL (secure sockets layer) technology. Because asymmetric encryption is usually more time-consuming than symmetric encryption, TLS uses the former only for its key exchange method. TLS systems then switch to symmetric encryption once the keys have been exchanged.

Most TLS implementations primarily support RSA as the chief asymmetrical encryption cipher, while ciphers such as RC4, Triple-DES, and AES are supported for symmetrical encryption.

## 10.2. Hashing

The hashing mechanism is used when a one-way, non-reversible form of data protection is required. Once hashing has been applied to a message, it is locked and no key is provided for the message to be unlocked. A common application of this mechanism is the storage of passwords.

Hashing technology can be used to derive a hashing code or message digest from a message, which is often of a fixed length and smaller than the original message. The message sender can then utilize the hashing mechanism to attach the message digest to the message. The recipient applies the same hash function to the message to verify that the produced message digest is identical to the one that accompanied the message. Any alteration to the original data results in an entirely different message digest and clearly indicates that tampering has occurred.

In addition to its utilization for protecting stored data, the cloud threats that can be mitigated by the hashing mechanism include malicious intermediary and insufficient authorization. 

## 10.3. Digital Signature

The digital signature mechanism is a means of providing data authenticity and integrity through authentication and non-repudiation. A message is assigned a digital signature prior to transmission, which is then rendered invalid if the message experiences any subsequent, unauthorized modifications. A digital signature provides evidence that the message received is the same as the one created by its rightful sender.

Both hashing and asymmetrical encryption are involved in the creation of a digital signature, which essentially exists as a message digest that was encrypted by a private key and appended to the original message. The recipient verifies the signature validity and uses the corresponding public key to decrypt the digital signature, which produces the message digest. The hashing mechanism can also be applied to the original message to produce this message digest. Identical results from the two different processes indicate that the message maintained its integrity.
