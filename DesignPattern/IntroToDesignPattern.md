## Basic
#### OO Basics
* Abstraction 
* Encapsulation 
* Polymorphism 
* Inheritance

#### OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor composition over inheritence.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## The power of a shared pattern vocabulary
When you communicate using patterns you are doing more than just sharing LINGO.

* Shared pattern vocabularies are POWERFUL.
  * When you communicate with another developer or your team using patterns, you are communicating not just a pattern name but a whole set of qualities, characteristics and constraints that the pattern represents.
* Patterns allow you to say more with less. 
  * When you use a pattern in a description, other developers quickly know precisely the design you have in mind.
* Talking at the pattern level allows you to stay “in the design” longer. 
  * Talking about software systems using patterns allows you to keep the discussion at the design level, without having to dive down to the nitty gritty details of implementing objects and classes.
* Shared vocabularies can turbo charge your development team. 
  * A team well versed in design patterns can move more quickly with less room for misunderstanding.
* Shared vocabularies encourage more junior developers to get up to speed. 
  * Junior developers look up to experienced developers. When senior developers make use of design patterns, junior developers also become motivated to learn them. Build a community of pattern users at your organization.
