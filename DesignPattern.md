## What are design patterns?
Software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

## WHy use design pattern?
Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced  object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to  general problems that software developers faced during software  development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by  numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.
Design patterns have two major benefits. 
* First, they provide you with a way to solve issues related to software development using a proven solution. The solution facilitates the development of highly cohesive modules with minimal coupling. They isolate the variability that may exist in the system requirements, making the overall system easier to understand and maintain. 
* Second, design patterns make communication between designers more efficient. Software professionals can immediately picture the high-level design in their heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a particular issue when discussing system design.
