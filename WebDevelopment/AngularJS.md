__AngularJS  is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework__ mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, a framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side __model–view–controller (MVC)__ and __model–view–viewmodel (MVVM)__ architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on Angular (Application Platform).

__The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has additional custom tag attributes embedded into it. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.__

AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic.[5] The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.

AngularJS's design goals include:

* to decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
* to decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
* to provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.

AngularJS implements the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components. Using dependency injection, Angular brings  traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.
