Chrome V8, or simply V8, is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. The projectâ€™s creator is Lars Bak. The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome: September 2, 2008. It has also been used in Couchbase, MongoDB and Node.js that are used server-side.

__V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as interpreting bytecode or compiling the whole program to machine code and executing it from a filesystem. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. Optimization techniques used include inlining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline caching.__
