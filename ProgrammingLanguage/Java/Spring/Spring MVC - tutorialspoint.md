The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

* The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO.  
* The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.  
* The Controller is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.  

### The DispatcherServlet

The Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a DispatcherServlet that handles all the HTTP requests and responses. The request processing workflow of the Spring Web MVC DispatcherServlet is illustrated in the following diagram:

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/images/spring_dispatcherservlet.png">

Following is the sequence of events corresponding to an incoming HTTP request to DispatcherServlet :

1. After receiving an HTTP request, DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping to call the appropriate Controller.  
2. The Controller takes the request and calls the appropriate service methods based on used GET or POST method. The service method will set model data based on defined business logic and returns view name to the DispatcherServlet.  
3. The DispatcherServlet will take help from ViewResolver to pickup the defined view for the request.  
4. Once view is finalized, The DispatcherServlet passes the model data to the view which is finally rendered on the browser.  

All the above-mentioned components, i.e. HandlerMapping, Controller, and ViewResolver are parts of WebApplicationContext  which is an extension of the plainApplicationContext with some extra features necessary for web applications.

#### Required Configuration

You need to map requests that you want the DispatcherServlet to handle, by using a URL mapping in the web.xml file. 

```xml
<web-app id = "WebApp_ID" version = "2.4"
   xmlns = "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" 
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee 
   http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
    
   <display-name>Spring MVC Application</display-name>
   
   <servlet>
      <servlet-name>HelloWeb</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>
         org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
      </servlet-class>
      <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
   </servlet>

   <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>HelloWeb</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

The web.xml file will be kept in the WebContent/WEB-INF directory of your web application. Upon initialization of HelloWeb DispatcherServlet, the framework will try to load the application context from a file named [servlet-name]-servlet.xml located in the application's WebContent/WEB-INFdirectory. In this case, our file will be HelloWebservlet.xml.

Next, <servlet-mapping> tag indicates what URLs will be handled by which DispatcherServlet. Here all the HTTP requests ending with .jsp will be handled by the HelloWeb DispatcherServlet.

Now, let us check the required configuration for HelloWeb-servlet.xml file, placed in your web application's WebContent/WEB-INF directory:

```xml
<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:context = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans     
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/context 
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd">

   <context:component-scan base-package = "com.tutorialspoint" />

   <bean class = "org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
      <property name = "prefix" value = "/WEB-INF/jsp/" />
      <property name = "suffix" value = ".jsp" />
   </bean>

</beans>
```

Following are the important points about HelloWeb-servlet.xml file âˆ’

* The [servlet-name]-servlet.xml file will be used to create the beans defined, overriding the definitions of any beans defined with the same name in the global scope.  
* The <context:component-scan...> tag will be use to activate Spring MVC annotation scanning capability which allows to make use of annotations like @Controller and @RequestMapping etc.  
* The InternalResourceViewResolver will have rules defined to resolve the view names. As per the above defined rule, a logical view named hello is delegated to a view implementation located at /WEB-INF/jsp/hello.jsp .  

### Spring overview

Spring framework is an open source Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and very rapidly. Spring framework was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. This tutorial has been written based on Spring Framework version 4.1.6 released in Mar 2015.

Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.

Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.

The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.

### Benefits of Using the Spring Framework

* Spring enables developers to develop enterprise-class applications using POJOs. The benefit of using only POJOs is that you do not need an EJB container product such as an application server but you have the option of using only a robust servlet container such as Tomcat or some commercial product.  
* Spring is organized in a modular fashion. Even though the number of packages and classes are substantial, you have to worry only about the ones you need and ignore the rest.  
* Spring does not reinvent the wheel, instead it truly makes use of some of the existing technologies like several ORM frameworks, logging frameworks, JEE, Quartz and JDK timers, and other view technologies. 
* Testing an application written with Spring is simple because environment-dependent code is moved into this framework. Furthermore, by using JavaBeanstyle POJOs, it becomes easier to use dependency injection for injecting test data.  
* Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as Struts or other over-engineered or less popular web frameworks.  
* Spring provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.  
* Lightweight IoC containers tend to be lightweight, especially when compared to EJB containers, for example. This is beneficial for developing and deploying applications on computers with limited memory and CPU resources.  
* Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using JTA, for example).  

### Dependency Injection (DI)

The technology that Spring is most identified with is the __Dependency Injection (DI)__ flavor of Inversion of Control. The __Inversion of Control (IoC)__ is a general concept, and it can be expressed in many different ways. Dependency Injection is merely one concrete example of Inversion of Control.

When writing a complex Java application, application classes should be as independent as possible of other Java classes to increase the possibility to reuse these classes and to test them independently of other classes while unit testing. Dependency Injection helps in gluing these classes together and at the same time keeping them independent.

What is dependency injection exactly? Let's look at these two words separately. Here the dependency part translates into an association between two classes. For example, class A is dependent of class B. Now, let's look at the second part, injection. All this means is, class B will get injected into class A by the IoC.

Dependency injection can happen in the way of passing parameters to the constructor or by post-construction using setter methods. As Dependency Injection is the heart of Spring Framework, we will explain this concept in a separate chapter with relevant example.

### Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

One of the key components of Spring is the Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) framework. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects including logging, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.

The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. DI helps you decouple your application objects from each other, while AOP helps you decouple cross-cutting concerns from the objects that they affect.

The AOP module of Spring Framework provides an aspect-oriented programming implementation allowing you to define method-interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated. We will discuss more about Spring AOP concepts in a separate chapter.

### Spring Framework - Architecture

Spring could potentially be a one-stop shop for all your enterprise applications. However, Spring is modular, allowing you to pick and choose which modules are applicable to you, without having to bring in the rest. The following section provides details about all the modules available in Spring Framework.

The Spring Framework provides about 20 modules which can be used based on an application requirement.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/images/spring_architecture.png">

### Core Container

The Core Container consists of the Core, Beans, Context, and Expression Language modules the details of which are as followsï¼š

* The __Core__ module provides the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features. 
* The __Bean__ module provides BeanFactory, which is a sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern. 
* The __Context__ module builds on the solid base provided by the Core and Beans modules and it is a medium to access any objects defined and configured. The ApplicationContext interface is the focal point of the Context module.  
* The __SpEL__ module provides a powerful expression language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.  

#### Data Access/Integration

The Data Access/Integration layer consists of the JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS and Transaction modules whose detail is as follows âˆ’

* The JDBC module provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need for tedious JDBC related coding.  
* The ORM module provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JPA, JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis.  
* The OXM module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object/XML mapping implementations for JAXB, Castor, XMLBeans, JiBX and XStream.  
* The Java Messaging Service JMS module contains features for producing and consuming messages.  
* The Transaction module supports programmatic and declarative transaction management for classes that implement special interfaces and for all your POJOs.  

#### Web

The Web layer consists of the Web, Web-MVC, Web-Socket, and Web-Portlet modules the details of which are as follows âˆ’

* The Web module provides basic web-oriented integration features such as multipart file-upload functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context.   
* The Web-MVC module contains Spring's Model-View-Controller (MVC) implementation for web applications.  
* The Web-Socket module provides support for WebSocket-based, two-way communication between the client and the server in web applications.  
* The Web-Portlet module provides the MVC implementation to be used in a portlet environment and mirrors the functionality of Web-Servlet module.  

#### Miscellaneous

There are few other important modules like AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation, Web and Test modules the details of which are as follows :

* The AOP module provides an aspect-oriented programming implementation allowing you to define method-interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated.  
* The Aspects module provides integration with AspectJ, which is again a powerful and mature AOP framework.  
* The Instrumentation module provides class instrumentation support and class loader implementations to be used in certain application servers.  
* The Messaging module provides support for STOMP as the WebSocket sub-protocol to use in applications. It also supports an annotation programming model for routing and processing STOMP messages from WebSocket clients.  
* The Test module supports the testing of Spring components with JUnit or TestNG frameworks.  

### Spring - IoC Containers

__The Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework. The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction. The Spring container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application. These objects are called Spring Beans.__

The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading the configuration metadata provided. The configuration metadata can be represented either by XML, Java annotations, or Java code. The following diagram represents a high-level view of how Spring works. The Spring IoC container makes use of Java POJO classes and configuration metadata to produce a fully configured and executable system or application.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/images/spring_ioc_container.jpg">

Spring provides the following two distinct types of containers:

#### Spring BeanFactory Container

This is the simplest container providing the basic support for DI and defined by the org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory interface. The BeanFactory and related interfaces, such as BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean, DisposableBean, are still present in Spring for the purpose of backward compatibility with a large number of third-party frameworks that integrate with Spring.

There are a number of implementations of the BeanFactory interface that are come straight out-of-the-box with Spring. The most commonly used BeanFactory implementation is the XmlBeanFactory class. This container reads the configuration metadata from an XML file and uses it to create a fully configured system or application.

The BeanFactory is usually preferred where the resources are limited like mobile devices or applet-based applications. Thus, use an ApplicationContext unless you have a good reason for not doing so.

#### Spring ApplicationContext Container

The Application Context is Spring's advanced container. Similar to BeanFactory, it can load bean definitions, wire beans together, and dispense beans upon request. Additionally, it adds more enterprise-specific functionality such as the ability to resolve textual messages from a properties file and the ability to publish application events to interested event listeners. This container is defined by org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface.

The ApplicationContext includes all functionality of the BeanFactory, It is generally recommended over BeanFactory. BeanFactory can still be used for lightweight applications like mobile devices or applet-based applications.

The most commonly used ApplicationContext implementations are:

* FileSystemXmlApplicationContext âˆ’ This container loads the definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you need to provide the full path of the XML bean configuration file to the constructor.    
* ClassPathXmlApplicationContext âˆ’ This container loads the definitions of the beans from an XML file. Here you do not need to provide the full path of the XML file but you need to set CLASSPATH properly because this container will look like bean configuration XML file in CLASSPATH.   
* WebXmlApplicationContext âˆ’ This container loads the XML file with definitions of all beans from within a web application.  
__The ApplicationContext container includes all functionality of the BeanFactorycontainer, so it is generally recommended over BeanFactory.__ BeanFactory can still be used for lightweight applications like mobile devices or applet-based applications where data volume and speed is significant.  

### Spring - Bean Definition

The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container. For example, in the form of XML <bean/> definitions which you have already seen in the previous chapters.

Bean definition contains the information called configuration metadata, which is needed for the container to know the following :

* How to create a bean  
* Bean's lifecycle details  
* Bean's dependencies  

#### Spring Configuration Metadata

Spring IoC container is totally decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata is actually written. Following are the three important methods to provide configuration metadata to the Spring Container :  

* XML based configuration file.  
* Annotation-based configuration.  
* Java-based configuration.  

#### Bean Scopes

When defining a <bean> you have the option of declaring a scope for that bean. For example, to force Spring to produce a new bean instance each time one is needed, you should declare the bean's scope attribute to be prototype. Similarly, if you want Spring to return the same bean instance each time one is needed, you should declare the bean's scope attribute to be singleton.
   
* singleton : This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).  
* prototype : This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.  
* request : This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.    
* session : This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.  
* global-session : This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.  

### Dependency Injection

Every Java-based application has a few objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a working application. When writing a complex Java application, application classes should be as independent as possible of other Java classes to increase the possibility to reuse these classes and to test them independently of other classes while unit testing. Dependency Injection (or sometime called wiring) helps in gluing these classes together and at the same time keeping them independent.

DI exists in two major variants and the following two sub-chapters will cover both of them with examples :

* Constructor-based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency on the other class.  
* Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.  

#### Injecting Inner Beans

As you know Java inner classes are defined within the scope of other classes, similarly, inner beans are beans that are defined within the scope of another bean. Thus, a <bean/> element inside the <property/> or <constructor-arg/> elements is called inner bean and it is shown below.  

```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

   <bean id = "outerBean" class = "...">
      <property name = "target">
         <bean id = "innerBean" class = "..."/>
      </property>
   </bean>

</beans>
```
