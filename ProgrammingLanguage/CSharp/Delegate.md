__C# delegates are similar to pointers to functions, in C or C++. A delegate is a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method. The reference can be changed at runtime.__

Delegates are especially used for implementing events and the call-back methods. All delegates are implicitly derived from the System.Delegate class.
