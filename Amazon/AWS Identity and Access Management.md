AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their permissions to AWS resources.

First time users should see the IAM Best Practices section of the IAM User Guide. To get started using IAM, sign in to the AWS Management Console.

IAM also enables identity federation between your corporate directory and AWS services. This lets you use existing corporate identities to grant secure access to AWS resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets, without creating new AWS identities for those users.
