> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.
—John Gall, Systemantics (1975)

In Chapter 10 we discussed batch processing—techniques that read a set of files as input and produce a new set of output files. The output is a form of derived data; that is, a dataset that can be recreated by running the batch process again if necessary. We saw how this simple but powerful idea can be used to create search indexes, recom‐ mendation systems, analytics, and more.

However, one big assumption remained throughout Chapter 10: namely, that the input is bounded—i.e., of a known and finite size—so the batch process knows when it has finished reading its input. For example, the sorting operation that is central to MapReduce must read its entire input before it can start producing output: it could happen that the very last input record is the one with the lowest key, and thus needs to be the very first output record, so starting the output early is not an option.

In reality, a lot of data is unbounded because it arrives gradually over time: your users produced data yesterday and today, and they will continue to produce more data tomorrow. Unless you go out of business, this process never ends, and so the dataset is never “complete” in any meaningful way. Thus, batch processors must artifi‐ cially divide the data into chunks of fixed duration: for example, processing a day’s worth of data at the end of every day, or processing an hour’s worth of data at the end of every hour.

The problem with daily batch processes is that changes in the input are only reflected in the output a day later, which is too slow for many impatient users. To reduce the delay, we can run the processing more frequently—say, processing a second’s worth of data at the end of every second—or even continuously, abandoning the fixed time slices entirely and simply processing every event as it happens. That is the idea behind stream processing.

In general, a “stream” refers to data that is incrementally made available over time. The concept appears in many places: in the stdin and stdout of Unix, programming languages (lazy lists), filesystem APIs (such as Java’s FileInputStream), TCP con‐ nections, delivering audio and video over the internet, and so on.

# Transmitting Event Streams

In the batch processing world, the inputs and outputs of a job are files (perhaps on a distributed filesystem). What does the streaming equivalent look like?

When the input is a file (a sequence of bytes), the first processing step is usually to parse it into a sequence of records. In a stream processing context, a record is more commonly known as an event, but it is essentially the same thing: a small, self- contained, immutable object containing the details of something that happened at some point in time. An event usually contains a timestamp indicating when it happened according to a time-of-day clock.

For example, the thing that happened might be an action that a user took, such as viewing a page or making a purchase. It might also originate from a machine, such as a periodic measurement from a temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric.

An event may be encoded as a text string, or JSON, or perhaps in some binary form. This encoding allows you to store an event, for example by appending it to a file, inserting it into a relational table, or writing it to a document database. It also allows you to send the event over the network to another node in order to process it.

In batch processing, a file is written once and then potentially read by multiple jobs. Analogously, in streaming terminology, an event is generated once by a producer (also known as a publisher or sender), and then potentially processed by multiple con‐ sumers (subscribers or recipients). In a filesystem, a filename identifies a set of related records; in a streaming system, related events are usually grouped together into a topic or stream.

In principle, a file or database is sufficient to connect producers and consumers: a producer writes every event that it generates to the datastore, and each consumer periodically polls the datastore to check for events that have appeared since it last ran. This is essentially what a batch process does when it processes a day’s worth of data at the end of every day.

However, when moving toward continual processing with low delays, polling becomes expensive if the datastore is not designed for this kind of usage. The more often you poll, the lower the percentage of requests that return new events, and thus the higher the overheads become. Instead, it is better for consumers to be notified when new events appear.

Databases have traditionally not supported this kind of notification mechanism very well: relational databases commonly have triggers, which can react to a change (e.g., a row being inserted into a table), but they are very limited in what they can do and have been somewhat of an afterthought in database design. Instead, specialized tools have been developed for the purpose of delivering event notifications.

### Messaging Systems

A common approach for notifying consumers about new events is to use a messaging system: a producer sends a message containing the event, which is then pushed to consumers. We touched on these systems previously in “Message-Passing Dataflow” on page 136, but we will now go into more detail.

A direct communication channel like a Unix pipe or TCP connection between pro‐ ducer and consumer would be a simple way of implementing a messaging system. However, most messaging systems expand on this basic model. In particular, Unix pipes and TCP connect exactly one sender with one recipient, whereas a messaging system allows multiple producer nodes to send messages to the same topic and allows multiple consumer nodes to receive messages in a topic.

Within this publish/subscribe model, different systems take a wide range of approaches, and there is no one right answer for all purposes. To differentiate the systems, it is particularly helpful to ask the following two questions:

1. What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can pro‐ cess them? Broadly speaking, there are three options: the system can drop mes‐ sages, buffer messages in a queue, or apply backpressure (also known as flow control; i.e., blocking the producer from sending more messages). For example, Unix pipes and TCP use backpressure: they have a small fixed-size buffer, and if it fills up, the sender is blocked until the recipient takes data out of the buffer.

If messages are buffered in a queue, it is important to understand what happens as that queue grows. Does the system crash if the queue no longer fits in mem‐ ory, or does it write messages to disk? If so, how does the disk access affect the performance of the messaging system ?

2. What happens if nodes crash or temporarily go offline—are any messages lost? As with databases, durability may require some combination of writing to disk and/or replication, which has a cost. If you can afford to sometimes lose messages, you can probably get higher throughput and lower latency on the same hardware.

Whether message loss is acceptable depends very much on the application. For exam‐ ple, with sensor readings and metrics that are transmitted periodically, an occasional missing data point is perhaps not important, since an updated value will be sent a short time later anyway. However, beware that if a large number of messages are dropped, it may not be immediately apparent that the metrics are incorrect. If you are counting events, it is more important that they are delivered reliably, since every lost message means incorrect counters.

A nice property of the batch processing systems we explored in Chapter 10 is that they provide a strong reliability guarantee: failed tasks are automatically retried, and partial output from failed tasks is automatically discarded. This means the output is the same as if no failures had occurred, which helps simplify the programming model. Later in this chapter we will examine how we can provide similar guarantees in a streaming context.

##### Direct messaging from producers to consumers

* UDP multicast is widely used in the financial industry for streams such as stock market feeds, where low latency is important. Although UDP itself is unrelia‐ ble, application-level protocols can recover lost packets (the producer must remember packets it has sent so that it can retransmit them on demand).  
* Brokerless messaging libraries such as ZeroMQ and nanomsg take a similar approach, implementing publish/subscribe messaging over TCP or IP multicast.  
* StatsD and Brubeck use unreliable UDP messaging for collecting metrics from all machines on the network and monitoring them. (In the StatsD protocol, counter metrics are only correct if all messages are received; using UDP makes the metrics at best approximate.)  
* If the consumer exposes a service on the network, producers can make a direct HTTP or RPC request (see “Dataflow Through Services: REST and RPC” on page 131) to push messages to the consumer. This is the idea behind webhooks [12], a pattern in which a callback URL of one service is registered with another service, and it makes a request to that URL whenever an event occurs.  

Although these direct messaging systems work well in the situations for which they are designed, they generally require the application code to be aware of the possibility of message loss. The faults they can tolerate are quite limited: even if the protocols detect and retransmit packets that are lost in the network, they generally assume that producers and consumers are constantly online.

If a consumer is offline, it may miss messages that were sent while it is unreachable. Some protocols allow the producer to retry failed message deliveries, but this approach may break down if the producer crashes, losing the buffer of messages that it was supposed to retry.

##### Message brokers

A widely used alternative is to send messages via a message broker (also known as a message queue), which is essentially a kind of database that is optimized for handling message streams. It runs as a server, with producers and consumers connecting to it as clients. Producers write messages to the broker, and consumers receive them by reading them from the broker.

By centralizing the data in the broker, these systems can more easily tolerate clients that come and go (connect, disconnect, and crash), and the question of durability is moved to the broker instead. Some message brokers only keep messages in memory, while others (depending on configuration) write them to disk so that they are not lost in case of a broker crash. Faced with slow consumers, they generally allow unboun‐ ded queueing (as opposed to dropping messages or backpressure), although this choice may also depend on the configuration.

A consequence of queueing is also that consumers are generally asynchronous: when a producer sends a message, it normally only waits for the broker to confirm that it has buffered the message and does not wait for the message to be processed by con‐ sumers. The delivery to consumers will happen at some undetermined future point in time—often within a fraction of a second, but sometimes significantly later if there is a queue backlog.

##### Message brokers compared to databases

Some message brokers can even participate in two-phase commit protocols using XA or JTA. This feature makes them quite similar in nature to databases, although there are still important practical differences between message brokers and databases:

* Databases usually keep data until it is explicitly deleted, whereas most message brokers automatically delete a message when it has been successfully delivered to its consumers. Such message brokers are not suitable for long-term data storage.  
* Since they quickly delete messages, most message brokers assume that their working set is fairly small—i.e., the queues are short. If the broker needs to buffer a lot of messages because the consumers are slow (perhaps spilling messages to disk if they no longer fit in memory), each individual message takes longer to process, and the overall throughput may degrade.    
* Databases often support secondary indexes and various ways of searching for data, while message brokers often support some way of subscribing to a subset of topics matching some pattern. The mechanisms are different, but both are essen‐ tially ways for a client to select the portion of the data that it wants to know about.  

* When querying a database, the result is typically based on a point-in-time snap‐ shot of the data; if another client subsequently writes something to the database that changes the query result, the first client does not find out that its prior result is now outdated (unless it repeats the query, or polls for changes). By contrast, message brokers do not support arbitrary queries, but they do notify clients when data changes (i.e., when new messages become available).  

This is the traditional view of message brokers, which is encapsulated in standards like JMS and AMQP and implemented in software like RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, Qpid, TIBCO Enterprise Message Service, IBM MQ, Azure Ser‐ vice Bus, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

##### Multiple consumers

When multiple consumers read messages in the same topic, two main patterns of messaging are used:

* Load balancing : Each message is delivered to one of the consumers, so the consumers can share the work of processing the messages in the topic. The broker may assign mes‐ sages to consumers arbitrarily. This pattern is useful when the messages are expensive to process, and so you want to be able to add consumers to parallelize the processing. (In AMQP, you can implement load balancing by having multi‐ ple clients consuming from the same queue, and in JMS it is called a shared subscription.)

* Fan-out : Each message is delivered to all of the consumers. Fan-out allows several inde‐ pendent consumers to each “tune in” to the same broadcast of messages, without affecting each other—the streaming equivalent of having several different batch jobs that read the same input file. (This feature is provided by topic subscriptions in JMS, and exchange bindings in AMQP.)

The two patterns can be combined: for example, two separate groups of consumers may each subscribe to a topic, such that each group collectively receives all messages, but within each group only one of the nodes receives each message.

##### Acknowledgments and redelivery

Consumers may crash at any time, so it could happen that a broker delivers a mes‐ sage to a consumer but the consumer never processes it, or only partially processes it before crashing. In order to ensure that the message is not lost, message brokers use acknowledgments: a client must explicitly tell the broker when it has finished process‐ ing a message so that the broker can remove it from the queue.

If the connection to a client is closed or times out without the broker receiving an acknowledgment, it assumes that the message was not processed, and therefore it delivers the message again to another consumer. (Note that it could happen that the message actually was fully processed, but the acknowledgment was lost in the net‐ work. Handling this case requires an atomic commit protocol.

### Partitioned Logs

Sending a packet over a network or making a request to a network service is normally a transient operation that leaves no permanent trace. Although it is possible to record it permanently (using packet capture and logging), we normally don’t think of it that way. Even message brokers that durably write messages to disk quickly delete them again after they have been delivered to consumers, because they are built around a transient messaging mindset.

Databases and filesystems take the opposite approach: everything that is written to a database or file is normally expected to be permanently recorded, at least until someone explicitly chooses to delete it again.

This difference in mindset has a big impact on how derived data is created. A key feature of batch processes, is that you can run them repeatedly, experimenting with the processing steps, without risk of damaging the input (since the input is read-only). This is not the case with AMQP/JMS-style messaging: receiving a message is destructive if the acknowledgment causes it to be deleted from the broker, so you cannot run the same consumer again and expect to get the same result.

If you add a new consumer to a messaging system, it typically only starts receiving messages sent after the time it was registered; any prior messages are already gone and cannot be recovered. Contrast this with files and databases, where you can add a new client at any time, and it can read data written arbitrarily far in the past (as long as it has not been explicitly overwritten or deleted by the application).

Why can we not have a hybrid, combining the durable storage approach of databases with the low-latency notification facilities of messaging? This is the idea behind log-based message brokers.

##### Using logs for message storage

A log is simply an append-only sequence of records on disk.  We previously discussed logs in the context of log-structured storage engines and write-ahead logs. The same structure can be used to implement a message broker: a producer sends a message by appending it to the end of the log, and a consumer receives messages by reading the log sequentially. If a consumer reaches the end of the log, it waits for a notification that a new message has been appended. The Unix tool tail -f, which watches a file for data being appended, essentially works like this.

In order to scale to higher throughput than a single disk can offer, the log can be partitioned. Different partitions can then be hosted on different machines, making each partition a separate log that can be read and written independently from other partitions. A topic can then be defined as a group of partitions that all carry messages of the same type.

Within each partition, the broker assigns a monotonically increasing sequence number, or offset, to every message. Such a sequence number makes sense because a partition is append-only, so the messages within a partition are totally ordered. There is no ordering guarantee across different partitions.

Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis Streams, and Twitter’s DistributedLog are log-based message brokers that work like this. Google Cloud Pub/Sub is architecturally similar but exposes a JMS-style API rather than a log abstraction. Even though these message brokers write all messages to disk, they are able to achieve throughput of millions of messages per second by partitioning across multiple machines, and fault tolerance by replicating messages.

##### Logs compared to traditional messaging

The log-based approach trivially supports fan-out messaging, because several consumers can independently read the log without affecting each other—reading a message does not delete it from the log. To achieve load balancing across a group of consumers, instead of assigning individual messages to consumer clients, the broker can assign entire partitions to nodes in the consumer group.

Each client then consumes all the messages in the partitions it has been assigned. Typically, when a consumer has been assigned a log partition, it reads the messages in the partition sequentially, in a straightforward single-threaded manner. This coarse- grained load balancing approach has some downsides:

* The number of nodes sharing the work of consuming a topic can be at most the number of log partitions in that topic, because messages within the same parti‐ tion are delivered to the same node.  
* If a single message is slow to process, it holds up the processing of subsequent messages in that partition.  

Thus, in situations where messages may be expensive to process and you want to par‐ allelize processing on a message-by-message basis, and where message ordering is not so important, the JMS/AMQP style of message broker is preferable. On the other hand, in situations with high message throughput, where each message is fast to pro‐ cess and where message ordering is important, the log-based approach works very well.

##### Consumer offsets

Consuming a partition sequentially makes it easy to tell which messages have been processed: all messages with an offset less than a consumer’s current offset have already been processed, and all messages with a greater offset have not yet been seen. Thus, the broker does not need to track acknowledgments for every single message— it only needs to periodically record the consumer offsets. The reduced bookkeeping overhead and the opportunities for batching and pipelining in this approach help increase the throughput of log-based systems.

This offset is in fact very similar to the log sequence number that is commonly found in single-leader database replication,. In database replication, the log sequence number allows a follower to reconnect to a leader after it has become disconnected, and resume replication without skipping any writes. Exactly the same principle is used here: the message broker behaves like a leader database, and the consumer like a follower.

If a consumer node fails, another node in the consumer group is assigned the failed consumer’s partitions, and it starts consuming messages at the last recorded offset. If the consumer had processed subsequent messages but not yet recorded their offset, those messages will be processed a second time upon restart. 

##### Disk space usage

If you only ever append to the log, you will eventually run out of disk space. To reclaim disk space, the log is actually divided into segments, and from time to time old segments are deleted or moved to archive storage. (We’ll discuss a more sophisti‐ cated way of freeing disk space later.)

This means that if a slow consumer cannot keep up with the rate of messages, and it falls so far behind that its consumer offset points to a deleted segment, it will miss some of the messages. Effectively, the log implements a bounded-size buffer that dis‐ cards old messages when it gets full, also known as a circular buffer or ring buffer. However, since that buffer is on disk, it can be quite large.

Let’s do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. At the time of writing, a typical large hard drive has a capacity of 6 TB and a sequential write throughput of 150 MB/s. If you are writing messages at the fastest possible rate, it takes about 11 hours to fill the drive. Thus, the disk can buffer 11 hours’ worth of messages, after which it will start overwriting old messages. This ratio remains the same, even if you use many hard drives and machines. In practice, deployments rarely use the full write bandwidth of the disk, so the log can typically keep a buffer of several days’ or even weeks’ worth of messages.

Regardless of how long you retain messages, the throughput of a log remains more or less constant, since every message is written to disk anyway. This behavior is in contrast to messaging systems that keep messages in memory by default and only write them to disk if the queue grows too large: such systems are fast when queues are short and become much slower when they start writing to disk, so the throughput depends on the amount of history retained.

##### When consumers cannot keep up with producers

At the beginning of “Messaging Systems” on page 441 we discussed three choices of what to do if a consumer cannot keep up with the rate at which producers are sending messages: dropping messages, buffering, or applying backpressure. In this taxon‐ omy, the log-based approach is a form of buffering with a large but fixed-size buffer (limited by the available disk space).

If a consumer falls so far behind that the messages it requires are older than what is retained on disk, it will not be able to read those messages—so the broker effectively drops old messages that go back further than the size of the buffer can accommodate. You can monitor how far a consumer is behind the head of the log, and raise an alert if it falls behind significantly. As the buffer is large, there is enough time for a human operator to fix the slow consumer and allow it to catch up before it starts missing messages.

Even if a consumer does fall too far behind and starts missing messages, only that consumer is affected; it does not disrupt the service for other consumers. This fact is a big operational advantage: you can experimentally consume a production log for development, testing, or debugging purposes, without having to worry much about disrupting production services. When a consumer is shut down or crashes, it stops consuming resources—the only thing that remains is its consumer offset.

This behavior also contrasts with traditional message brokers, where you need to be careful to delete any queues whose consumers have been shut down—otherwise they continue unnecessarily accumulating messages and taking away memory from consumers that are still active.

##### Replaying old messages

We noted previously that with AMQP- and JMS-style message brokers, processing and acknowledging messages is a destructive operation, since it causes the messages to be deleted on the broker. On the other hand, in a log-based message broker, con‐ suming messages is more like reading from a file: it is a read-only operation that does not change the log.

The only side effect of processing, besides any output of the consumer, is that the consumer offset moves forward. But the offset is under the consumer’s control, so it can easily be manipulated if necessary: for example, you can start a copy of a con‐ sumer with yesterday’s offsets and write the output to a different location, in order to reprocess the last day’s worth of messages. You can repeat this any number of times, varying the processing code.

This aspect makes log-based messaging more like the batch processes of the last chapter, where derived data is clearly separated from input data through a repeatable transformation process. It allows more experimentation and easier recovery from errors and bugs, making it a good tool for integrating dataflows within an organization。
