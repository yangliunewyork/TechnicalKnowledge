When we revamped Messages in 2010 to integrate SMS, chat, email and Facebook Messages into one inbox, we built the product on open-source Apache HBase, a distributed key value data store running on top of HDFS, and extended it to meet our requirements. At the time, __HBase was chosen as the underlying durable data store because it provided the high write throughput and low latency random read performance necessary for our Messages platform. In addition, it provided other important features, including horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability via automatic failover.__ Since then, weâ€™ve expanded the HBase footprint across Facebook, using it not only for point-read, online transaction processing workloads like Messages, but also for online analytics processing workloads where large data scans are prevalent. Today, in addition to Messages, HBase is used in production by other Facebook services, including our internal monitoring system, the recently launched Nearby Friends feature, search indexing, streaming data analysis, and data scraping for our internal data warehouses.
