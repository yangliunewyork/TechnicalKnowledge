A Translation management system (TMS) (formerly globalization management system (GMS)) is a type of software for automating many parts of the human language translation process and maximizing translator efficiency. The ideal of a translation management system is to automate all repeatable and non-essential work that can be done by software/systems and leaving only the creative work of translation and review to be done by human beings. A translation management system generally includes at least two types of technology: process management technology to automate the flow of work, and linguistic technology to aid the translator.

In a typical TMS, process management technology is used to monitor source language content for changes and route the content to various translators and reviewers. These translators and reviewers may be located across the globe and typically access the TMS via the Internet.

Translation management systems are most commonly used today for managing various aspects translation business. 

Although Translation Management Systems (TMS) seems to be the currently favoured term in the localization industry, these solutions are also known as Globalization Management Systems (GMS) or Global Content Management Systems (GCMS). They work with Content management systems (CMS) as separate, but linked programs or as simple add-ons that can answer specific multilingual requirements.
