## What is service-oriented architecture ?

A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:
* It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
* It is self-contained.
* It is a black box for its consumers
* It may consist of other underlying services.

Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large software application. Service-oriented architecture makes it easier for software components to communicate and cooperate over the network, without requiring any human interaction or changes in the underlying program, so that service candidates can be redesigned before their implementation.

## Overview
In SOA, services use protocols which describe how they pass and parse messages using description metadata. This metadata describes both the functional characteristics of the service and quality-of-service characteristics. Service-oriented architecture aims to allow users to combine large chunks of functionality to form applications which are built purely from existing services and combining them in an ad hoc manner. A service presents a simple interface to the requester that abstracts away the underlying complexity acting as a black box, Further users can also access these independent services without any knowledge of their internal implementation.

## Defining concepts
The related buzzword service-orientation promotes loose coupling between services. SOA separates functions into distinct units, or services, which developers make accessible over a network in order to allow users to combine and reuse them in the production of applications. These services and their corresponding consumers communicate with each other by passing data in a well-defined, shared format, or by coordinating an activity between two or more services.

A manifesto was published for service-oriented architecture in October, 2009. This came up with six core values which are listed as follows:

* Business value is given more importance than technical strategy.
* Strategic goals is given more importance than project-specific benefits.
* Intrinsic inter-operability is given more importance than custom integration.
* Shared services is given more importance than specific-purpose implementations.
* Flexibility is given more importance than optimization.
* Evolutionary refinement is given more importance than pursuit of initial perfection.

SOA can be seen as part of the continuum which ranges from the older concept of distributed computing[6][9] and modular programming, through SOA, and on to current practices of mashups, SaaS, and cloud computing (which some see as the offspring of SOA).
