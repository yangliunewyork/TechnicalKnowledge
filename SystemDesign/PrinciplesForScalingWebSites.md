## Rule 1 - Don’t Overengineer the Solution
Overengineering (or over-engineering) is the designing of a product to be more robust or complicated than is necessary for its application, either (charitably) to ensure sufficient factor of safety, sufficient functionality, or because of design errors. Overengineering can be desirable when safety or performance on a particular criterion is critical, or when extremely broad functionality is required, but it is generally criticized from the point of view of value engineering as wasteful. As a design philosophy, such overcomplexity is the opposite of the less is more school of thought.

AsWikipedia explains, overengineering falls into two broad categories.1 The first category covers products designed and implemented to exceed the useful requirements of the product.The second category of overengineering covers products that are made to be overly complex.

## Rule 2—Design Scale into theSolution (D-I-D Process)


## Rule 3—Simplify the Solution 3 Times Over

## Rule 4—Reduce DNS Lookups
