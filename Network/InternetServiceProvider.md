### What Are the Services Offered by Internet Service Providers?

As most know, the Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks used by billions of people across the world. This system of networks is linked by a vast assortment of electronic, optical networking and wireless technologies.

### ISP Tiers
* Tier 1 ISPs are large national or international ISPs. They are directly connected to the Internet backbone and can be considered part of the backbone itself. They have the highest speed connections and very reliable networks. Their customers are either lower-tiered ISPs or large companies that are looking for a very reliable and fast access to the Internet. A major advantage of purchasing service from a tier 1 ISP is if there is a problem with access, only one company is involved, so solving the problem is that much easier. Sprint is a tier 1 ISP.

* Tier 2 ISPs purchase their Internet service from a tier 1 ISP. Tier 2 ISPs tend to cover a specific region. They focus on business customers and have lower quality networks and slower access than tier 1 ISPs.

* Tier 3 ISPs also purchase their Internet service from tier 1 ISPs. Tier 3 ISPs tend to focus on the retail market, and they also tend to cover a specific region. Network quality and access speed are relatively low. Prices are much lower than for tier 2 or tier 1 ISPs.
