## What is Internet ?

### A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world. In Internet jargon,
all of these devices are called hosts or end systems. End systems are connected together by a network of __communication links__ and __packet switches__. There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the __transmission rate__ of a link measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as __packets__ in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are __routers__ and __link-layer switches__. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a __route__ or __path__ through the network.

End systems access the Internet through __Internet Service Providers (ISPs)__, including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL, access. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web sites directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT. An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol, and conforms to certain naming and address conventions.

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The __Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)__ and the __Internet Protocol (IP)__ are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as __TCP/IP__.

### A Services Description
Our discussion above has identified many of the pieces that make up the Internet. But we can also describe the Internet from an entirely different angle—namely, as an infrastructure that provides services to applications. These applications include electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voiceover- IP (VoIP), video streaming, distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more. The applications are said to be distributed applications, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. Importantly, Internet applications run on end systems—they do not run in the packet switches in the network core. Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.

End systems attached to the Internet provide an __Application Programming Interface (API)__ that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. This Internet API is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program. This Internet API is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program. We’ll discuss the Internet API in detail in Chapter 2. For now, let’s draw upon a simple analogy, one that we will frequently use in this book. Suppose Alice wants to send a letter to Bob using the postal service. Alice, of course, can’t just write the letter (the data) and drop the letter out her window. Instead, the postal service requires that Alice put the letter in an envelope; write Bob’s full name, address, and zip code in the center of the envelope; seal the envelope; put a stamp in the upper-right-hand corner of the envelope; and finally, drop the envelope into an official postal service mailbox. Thus, the postal service has its own “postal service API,” or set of rules, that Alice must follow to have the postal service deliver her letter to Bob. In a similar manner, the Internet has an API that the program sending data must follow to have the Internet deliver the data to the program that will receive the data. The postal service, of course, provides more than one service to its customers. It provides express delivery, reception confirmation, ordinary use, and many more services. In a similar manner, the Internet provides multiple services to its applications. When you develop an Internet application, you too must choose one of the Internet’s services for your application.

### What Is a Protocol?

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two network interface cards; congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination. Protocols are running everywhere in the Internet, and consequently much of this book is about computer network protocols.


> A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

## The Network Edge
The computers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as end sys- tems. They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet. The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g., desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and mobile computers (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets). Furthermore, an increasing number of non-traditional devices are being attached to the Internet as end sys- tems (see sidebar).

End systems are also referred to as __hosts__ because they host (that is, run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program. Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: __clients__ and __servers__. Informally, clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on. Today, most of the servers from which we receive search results, e-mail, Web pages, and videos reside in large data centers. 

### Access Networks

The network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system. 

* Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite

Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP.  Each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone line  to exchange data with a __digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM)__ located in the __telco__’s local __central office (CO)__. 

The home’s DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high- frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM. 

While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure, cable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. A residence obtains cable Internet access from the same company that provides its cable television.

Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format. Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the down- stream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel. 


One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels down- stream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultane- ously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.

#### Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi

On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a __local area network (LAN)__ is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Although there are many types of LAN technologies, __Ethernet__ is by far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home networks. Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch. The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then in turn connected into the larger Internet. 

Increasingly, however, people are accessing the Internet wirelessly from lap- tops, smartphones, tablets, and other devices . In a wireless LAN setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point that is connected into the enterprise’s network (most likely including wired Ethernet), which in turn is connected to the wired Internet. A wireless LAN user must typically be within a few tens of meters of the access point. __Wireless LAN__ access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known as __WiFi__.

Even though Ethernet and WiFi access networks were initially deployed in enter- prise (corporate, university) settings, they have recently become relatively common components of home networks. Many homes combine broadband residential access (that is, cable modems or DSL) with these inexpensive wireless LAN technologies to create powerful home networks. This home network consists of a roaming laptop as well as a wired PC; a base station (the wireless access point), which communicates with the wireless PC; a cable modem, providing broadband access to the Internet; and a router, which interconnects the base station and the stationary PC with the cable modem. This network allows household members to have broadband access to the Internet with one mem- ber roaming from the kitchen to the backyard to the bedrooms.

#### Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE
 Increasingly, devices such as iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android devices are being used to send email, surf the Web, Tweet, and download music while on the run. These devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular net- work provider. __Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station.__
 
Telecommunications companies have made enormous investments in so-called __third-generation (3G) wireless__, which provides packet-switched wide-area wireless Internet access at speeds in excess of 1 Mbps. But even higher-speed wide-area access technologies—a fourth-generation (4G) of wide-area wireless networks—are already being deployed. LTE ( for “Long-Term Evolution”—a candidate for Bad Acronym of the Year Award) has its roots in 3G technology, and can potentially achieve rates in excess of 10 Mbps. LTE downstream rates of many tens of Mbps have been reported in commercial deployments. 


### Physical Media

For each transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a __physical medium__. Physical media fall into two categories: __guided media__ and __unguided media__. With guided media, the waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel.

## The Network Core

### Packet Switching
In a network application, end systems exchange __messages__ with each other. Messages can contain anything the application designer wants. Messages may perform a control function or can contain data, such as an email message, a JPEG image, or an MP3 audio file. To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and __packet switches__ (for which there are two predominant types, __routers__ and __link-layer switches__). Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or a packet switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec, then the time to transmit the packet is L/R seconds.

### Store-and-Forward Transmission
Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. 

#### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss
Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an __output buffer__ (also called an __output queue__), which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link. The output buffers play a key role in packet switching. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer. Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer output buffer __queuing delays__. These delays are variable and depend on the level of congestion in the network. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets wait- ing for transmission. In this case, __packet loss__ will occur—either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.

#### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header. As with postal addresses, this address has a hierarchical structure. When a packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of the packet’s destination address and for- wards the packet to an adjacent router. More specifically, each router has a __forwarding table__ that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to this outbound link.

The Internet has a number of special routing protocols that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may, for exam- ple, determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers.

### Circuit Switching
There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: __circuit switching__ and __packet switching__. Having covered packet- switched networks in the previous subsection, we now turn our attention to circuit- switched networks.

__In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand, and as a consequence, may have to wait (that is, queue) for access to a communication link.__ 

__Traditional telephone networks are examples of circuit-switched networks.__ Consider what happens when one person wants to send information (voice or fac- simile) to another over a telephone network. Before the sender can send the infor- mation, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver. This is a bona fide connection for which the switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection. In the jargon of telephony, this connection is called a circuit. When the network establishes the __circuit__, it also reserves a constant transmission rate in the net- work’s links (representing a fraction of each link’s transmission capacity) for the duration of the connection. Since a given transmission rate has been reserved for this sender-to-receiver connection, the sender can transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate.


In contrast, consider what happens when one host wants to send a packet to another host over a packet-switched network, such as the Internet. As with circuit switching, the packet is transmitted over a series of communication links. But different from circuit switching, the packet is sent into the network without reserving any link resources whatsoever. If one of the links is congested because other packets need to be transmitted over the link at the same time, then the packet will have to wait in a buffer at the sending side of the transmission link and suffer a delay. The Internet makes its best effort to deliver packets in a timely manner, but it does not make any guarantees.

#### Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks
A circuit in a link is implemented with either __frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)__ or __time-division multiplexing (TDM)__. With FDM, the frequency spec- trum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link.Specifically, the link dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the duration of the connection. In telephone networks, this frequency band typically has a width of 4 kHz (that is, 4,000 hertz or 4,000 cycles per second). The width of the band is called, not surprisingly, the __bandwidth__. FM radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz, with each station being allocated a specific frequency band.


For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots. When the network establishes a connec- tion across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connec- tion. These slots are dedicated for the sole use of that connection, with one time slot available for use (in every frame) to transmit the connection’s data.For TDM, the transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot. Proponents of packet switching have always argued that circuit switching is wasteful because the dedicated circuits are idle during __silent periods__. Proponents of packet switching also enjoy pointing out that establishing end-to-end circuits and reserving end-to-end transmission capacity is complicated and requires complex signaling software to coordinate the operation of the switches along the end-to-end path.

#### Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching
Having described circuit switching and packet switching, let us compare the two. Critics of packet switching have often argued that packet switching is not suitable for real-time services (for example, telephone calls and video conference calls) because of its variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays (due primarily to vari- able and unpredictable queuing delays). Proponents of packet switching argue that (1) it offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching and (2) it is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching. 

Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regard- less of demand, with allocated but unneeded link time going unused. Packet switching on the other hand allocates link use on demand.Link transmission capac- ity will be shared on a packet-by-packet basis only among those users who have packets that need to be transmitted over the link.
