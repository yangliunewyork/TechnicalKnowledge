__A wireless local area network (WLAN)__ is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building. This gives users the ability to move around within a local coverage area and yet still be connected to the network. A WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.

Wireless LANs have become popular for use in the home, due to their ease of installation and use. They are also popular in commercial properties that offer wireless access to their customers.

# Types of wireless LANs

The IEEE 802.11 has two basic modes of operation: __infrastructure__ and __ad hoc__ mode. In ad hoc mode, mobile units transmit directly __peer-to-peer__. In infrastructure mode, mobile units communicate through an __access point__ that serves as a bridge to other networks (such as Internet or LAN).

#### Infrastructure

Most Wi-Fi networks are deployed in infrastructure mode.

In infrastructure mode, a base station acts as a wireless access point hub, and nodes communicate through the hub. The hub usually, but not always, has a wired or fiber network connection, and may have permanent wireless connections to other nodes.
Wireless access points are usually fixed, and provide service to their client nodes within range. 

Wireless clients, such as laptops, smartphones etc. connect to the access point to join the network.

Sometimes a network will have a multiple access points, with the same 'SSID' and security arrangement. In that case connecting to any access point on that network joins the client to the network. In that case, the client software will try to choose the access point to try to give the best service, such as the access point with the strongest signal.

#### Peer-to-peer

An ad hoc network (not the same as a WiFi Direct network) is a network where stations communicate only peer to peer (P2P). There is no base and no one gives permission to talk. This is accomplished using the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS).


A peer-to-peer network allows wireless devices to directly communicate with each other. Wireless devices within range of each other can discover and communicate directly without involving central access points. This method is typically used by two computers so that they can connect to each other to form a network. This can basically occur in devices within a closed range.
