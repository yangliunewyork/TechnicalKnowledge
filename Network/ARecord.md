### What is an A record?

An A record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer hosting the domain. Simply put, an A record is used to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet from a name.

The A in A record stands for Address. Whenever you visit a web site, send an email, connect to Twitter or Facebook or do almost anything on the Internet, the address you enter is a series of words connected with dots.

For example, to access the DNSimple website you enter www.dnsimple.com. At our name server there is an A record that points to the IP address 208.93.64.253. This means that a request from your browser to www.dnsimple.com is directed to the server with IP address 208.93.64.253.

A Records are the simplest type of DNS records, yet one of the primary records used in DNS servers.

You can actually do quite a bit more with A records, including using multiple A records for the same domain in order to provide redundancy. Additionally, multiple names could point to the same address, in which case each would have its own A record pointing to the that same IP address.

### Querying A records

You can use dig to determine the A record associated to a domain name. The result is contained in the ANSWER section and it contains the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), the remaining time-to-live (TTL) and the IP address.
```
$ dig A api.dnsimple.com

### A record format

In DNSimple we represent A record with the following information:

* __Name__	The host name for the record, without the domain name. This is generally referred as “subdomain”. We automatically append the domain name.
* __TTL__	The time-to-leave in seconds. This is the amount of time the record is allowed to be cached by a resolver.
* __Address__	The IPv4 address the A record points to.
