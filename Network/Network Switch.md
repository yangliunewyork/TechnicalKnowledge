A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device.

A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses hardware addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality that most commonly uses IP addresses to perform packet forwarding; such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches.

# Router vs Switch

##### What is a Router?

__A router is a networking device that connects computer networks__, for example, connecting a home network with the Internet. Routers are the workhorses that transfer packets of data between networks to establish and sustain communication between two nodes in an internetwork. __Routers operate at Layer 3 (network layer) of the OSI model; a router uses the destination IP address in a data packet to determine where to forward the packet.__

##### What is a Network Switch?

__A network switch connects devices together on a single computer network.__ A switch is also called switching hub, bridging hub, or MAC bridge. Switches use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. __A switch is considered a Layer 2 device, operating at the data link layer; switches use packet switching to receive, process and forward data.__

##### What is a Network Hub?

Network hubs — also called repeaters — are even less advanced that switches; while a hub broadcasts the same data to all its ports, a network switch forwards data only to those devices that the data is intended for. Network hubs do not manage any traffic coming through them; they only broadcast — or repeat — packets from an incoming port to all other ports.


##### Function of a Switch vs. a Router

A router is a more sophisticated device than a switch. Traditional routers are designed to join multiple area networks (LANs and WANs). __Routers serve as intermediate destinations for network traffic. They receive TCP/IP packets, look inside each packet to identify the source and target IP addresses, then forward these packets as needed to ensure the data reaches its final destination.__ In addition, routers often perform network address translation (NAT), which allows all devices on a subnetwork (e.g., all devices in a home) to share the same public IP address. Finally, routers that include built-in firewalls improve the network's security.

__A network switch is a small hardware device that joins multiple computers together within one local area network (LAN). Switches are incapable of joining multiple networks or sharing an Internet connection.__ A home network with a switch must designate one computer as the gateway to the Internet, and that device must possess two network adapters for sharing, one for the home LAN and one for the Internet WAN. With a router, all home computers connect to the router equally, and it performs the equivalent gateway functions.
