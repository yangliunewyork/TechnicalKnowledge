Within Internet message handling services (MHS), a __message transfer agent__ or __mail transfer agent (MTA)__ or mail relay is software that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another using a clientâ€“server application architecture. An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

The terms __mail server__, mail exchanger, and MX host may also refer to a computer performing the MTA function. The Domain Name System (DNS) associates a mail server to a domain with an MX record containing the domain name of the host(s) providing MTA services.

A mail server is a computer that serves as an electronic post office for email. Mail exchanged across networks is passed between mail servers that run specially designed software. This software is built around agreed-upon, standardized protocols for handling not only mail messages, but also any data files (such as images, multimedia or documents) that might be attached to them.
