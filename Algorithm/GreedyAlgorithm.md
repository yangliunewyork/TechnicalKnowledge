# What is greedy algorithm?

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

# Specifics
In general, greedy algorithms have five components:
1. A candidate set, from which a solution is created
2. A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution
3. A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution
4. An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and
5. A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution

# Examples
1. KMST(Kruskal's minimum spanning tree)
2. Huffman coding(preferably efficient version of the algorithm for sorted Input)
3. PMST(Prim's minimum spanning tree)
4. PMST for adjacency line representation
5. Dijkstra's shortest path(its one of the popular one)
6. Graph colouring
