Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

The initial release of Docker was in March 2013 and since then, it has become the buzzword for modern world development, especially in the face of Agile-based projects.

### Features of Docker

* Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.
* With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.
* You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.
* Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.
