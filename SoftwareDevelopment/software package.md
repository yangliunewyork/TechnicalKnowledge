A software package is a collection of executables and or dynamically linked libraries (DLL files in Windows or shared object [.so] in UNIX. The later are external code which is able to be loaded into memory at any time by any number of programs.

Some examples are directX, libmesa which are used for graphics. There are tons of other libraries too, some are tools for encryption, networking, audio, shared memory and so on.

A software package is an assemblage of files and information about those files.

Linux distributions are usually installed as separate software packages, each of which is a particular application, such as a Web browser or a development environment. Each package includes an archive of files and information about the software, such as its name, the specific version and a description. A package management system (PMS), such as rpm or YUM, automates the installation process.
