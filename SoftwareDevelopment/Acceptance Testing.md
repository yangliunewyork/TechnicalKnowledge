ACCEPTANCE TESTING is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

### Analogy

During the process of manufacturing a ballpoint pen, the cap, the body, the tail and clip, the ink cartridge and the ballpoint are produced separately and unit tested separately. When two or more units are ready, they are assembled and Integration Testing is performed. When the complete pen is integrated, System Testing is performed. Once System Testing is complete, Acceptance Testing is performed so as to confirm that the ballpoint pen is ready to be made available to the end-users.

### What is Acceptance Testing?

Acceptance testing, a testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it is has met the required criteria for delivery to end users.

There are various forms of acceptance testing:

* User acceptance Testing  
* Business acceptance Testing  
* Alpha Testing  
* Beta Testing

The acceptance test cases are executed against the test data or using an acceptance test script and then the results are compared with the expected ones. 

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are defined on the basis of the following attributes

* Functional Correctness and Completeness
* Data Integrity
* Data Conversion
* Usability
* Performance
* Timeliness
* Confidentiality and Availability
* Installability and Upgradability
* Scalability
* Documentation
